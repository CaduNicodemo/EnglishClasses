                        Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some information about the class. <br><br> Our
                        class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13. <br><br>We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes,
                        so we finish at 6 p.m. That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK? <br><br> Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office 7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions
                        or problems or want to talk to me, it's Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.<br><br> We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.<br><br> I think
                        that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to see any photocopies of the book, thank you!
                        Remember, it's level 1 student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book. <br><br>I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!

                                <br> This is a tricky one. I can't pick one person. I'd have to say my family.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think like a lot of people I'd probably say my mum. She's my rock and my best friend.

                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Rollercoasters. I'm absolutely terrified of being upside down.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Dentists. I scream like a baby.

                                <br> My turn. Question three: How do you take your coffee?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> It's never just coffee. I prefer cappuccinos, darling!
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I'm more of a typical British tea drinker. If I do have a coffee I usually have an Americano with cold milk. Cold milk is very important.
Can I do another one? Question four: When did you last cry?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> When I became an uncle.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think mine was the last time I went to see a musical. The show was so beautiful I was moved to tears.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Question five: Are you feeling excited?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Yes! It's really exciting to be here and I'm quite an excitable person.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br>Yes, very excited.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br>OK, question six. This comes in three parts. Do you speak another language?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Yes, I have attempted to learn several languages.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Which ones?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Bengali, Hindi and Urdu are my strongest and I'm learning Farsi and French.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I've studied French and Mandarin and Japanese, but I'm not very good at any of them.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> And can you sing a song in French?
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> How about Frere Jacque? (Sings) Come on Amith - your turn.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> OK, a song in Hindi (Sings).
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> That was lovely Amith! I think that's all we've got time for with questions. I think we know each other a little better now.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I think we do!

                        Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        And me, Sophie. Hello. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Today’s programme is all about questions. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes: we’ll take a look at different types of yes-no questions… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        We’ll hear lots of w-h questions… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And we’ll be using the questions to get to know each other a little bit better.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        So if you want a reminder of English question forms… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Or if you’re if you’re studying them for the first time… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Keep listening and join in with the task we’ll be giving you later on. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        So let’s get started. 
                        In English, there are two basic question types: <b>yes/no questions</b> and <b>w-h questions.</b> <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And here’s Finn with our first yes-no question: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Can you speak English? Can you speak English? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Thanks Finn. That’s a useful first question. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, and it’s made with the auxiliary verb <b>can</b>, plus the subject you</b> and a verb: speak.</b> Can you 
                        speak? Can you speak English Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Yes, I can. Another question please Finn? <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Do you work every day? Do you work every day? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb <b>work.</b> Do you work every day, Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I don't, no. I don't work at weekends. Finn? <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Do you have any brothers and sisters? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb: <b>have</b>. Neil, do you have any brothers or sisters? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Yes I do I've got one sister. Now another way to make yes-no questions is with the verb <b>to be</b> plus a subject. Let’s demonstrate. Sophie: Are you married? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        No, Neil, I’m not. Is your boss married? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        My boss? No, he isn't. Were you in the office yesterday? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, sadly I was in the office yesterday. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And we're talking about question forms.  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now the second main type of question in English starts with either <b>what</b>, <b>where</b>, <b>when</b>, <b>which</b>, 
                        <b>why</b>, <b>who</b>, or the odd one out: <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        … <b>how.</b> <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        So let’s try making a question with <b>where.</b> We add an auxiliary… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        … such as <b>do</b> <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        … then we can add a subject plus a verb. For example: Neil: Where do you live? Where do you 
                        live? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I live in south London. Where do you live Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        I live in north London. Now let’s change the question word and the verb. Which languages 
                        do you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And here we add a noun to <b>which:</b> Which languages do you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Just English. And with a different auxiliary: Which languages can you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        We can add nouns to some of the other question words: What time do you start work? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        About 9 o'clock in the morning. And if we ask What time is it? We’re making a <b>w-h</b> question 
                        with the verb <b>to be.</b> I can ask: Where were you born? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I was born in England. When is your birthday? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        In September. What is your work address? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        It's W1A. Lots of useful questions with <b>to be</b> there. Now for a very personal question with 
                        <b>to be</b>: Sophie: How old are you? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        You should never ask a woman her age! And for questions with <b>how</b>, we usually add an 
                        extra word. To ask about age it’s: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How old… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        For price it’s: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How much… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        For size we ask: <br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How big… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And for height it’s  <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How tall.  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        How tall are you, Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        About 180cm. And of course, you can’t answer a <b>w-h</b> question with <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> How tall are 
                        you, Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        I think we're actually the same height.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Let me see, back to back… No, I'm taller! 
                        Is it time for a practice task Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, it is. Join in at home if you like. I’m going to give you a topic to ask me about, and you 
                        have to make one <b>yes/no</b> question and one <b>w-h</b> question. And Neil will give some possible 
                        answers. Here’s the first topic: Ask me about my age. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b>: <br>
                        Ok so you could ask: How old are you? When were you born? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now ask me about my home. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Do you live with your family? What is your address? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now ask me about my work. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Do you work near here? How much do you earn? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Thanks Neil. And well done to you at home if you joined in with the task.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        So that’s a look at some basic question types we can use when we’re getting to know 
                        people. We had <b>yes/no</b> questions...  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And we looked at questions starting with <b>w-h</b> words.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And we found out some interesting information about each other. I didn’t know how tall 
                        you were, Sophie?! <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I know, it's quite amazing really. And there’s lots more about questions forms on our

                                <b>Narrator</b><br>
This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who loved money and didn't like Christmas. There he was, on Christmas Eve, in his office. He was keeping an eye on his clerk Bob Cratchit. Scrooge wanted to get every little bit of work from Cratchit before allowing him to spend Christmas Day at home. Scrooge thought Christmas was a waste of time! Even his nephew couldn't convince him that it wasn't. <br><br>
<b>IN SCROOGE'S OFFICE</b><br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
A Merry Christmas, uncle!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Bah! Humbug!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
You don't mean that, I'm sure!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money? You find yourself a year older, but not an hour richer! What good has it ever done you?<br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
I've always thought of Christmas as a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time. A time when men and women seem to open their hearts freely. It's never put money in my pocket, but I believe that it's done me good!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Humbug!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
Come on, uncle, come and have dinner with us tomorrow.<br><br>
<b>Narrator</b><br>
Scrooge's nephew was persistent but the old man wouldn't change his mind. He was in his usual bad mood when two gentlemen came to his office to ask for a donation to offer Christmas dinner to the poor. Scrooge worked in the money-lending business. No donation from him...<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Gentlemen, are there no prisons and workhouses, where the poor receive food and accommodation in return for some work?<br><br>
<b>Gentleman</b><br>
We wish we could say there aren't any, Mr Scrooge. Many poor people would rather die than go to prison or the...<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
They should die and decrease the surplus population. And... well, it's none of my business anyway. They cost a lot of money, and the poor should go there. Goodbye, sir.<br><br>
<b>Narrator</b><br>
Typical Scrooge! He feels sorry for no-one, helps no-one. With him, it's all about money. He thought of nothing else. His partner, Jacob Marley, had died seven years before, at Christmas. Marley was like Scrooge when he was alive. But now he was gone. Or was he?<br><br>
<b>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE </b><br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Who's there? I'm finally home and I want some peace!<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
Scroooge... Scrooooooge...<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
What is this? A ghost?! It's not possible! I must be having indigestion and seeing things that aren't there!<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
Scrooge. In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Marley, is it really you?! And what is this strange metal chain you are wearing? It's made of cash-boxes, keys, locks, heavy purses...<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
I wear the chain I made in life. Of my own free will I wore it when I was alive. Is its pattern strange to you? Or do you wish to know the weight and length of the heavy chain you are carrying yourself? <br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Don't say that, Jacob. And why is this happening to you? You were always a good man of business…<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
Business!? Mankind was my business. Charity, kindness - were all my business. Why did I walk through crowds of people with my eyes turned down? I'm here to warn you, that you still have a chance of escaping my fate. You'll be visited by three spirits. Expect the first spirit tomorrow at one o'clock in the morning. And remember what I've told you.<br><br>
<b>Narrator</b><br>
Marley disappeared into the night, flying out of an open window with other ghosts which looked as miserable as him. Scrooge was shocked. I'll tell you about the visit of the first spirit next time<br>

Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn...<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
And I’m Alice. Today we’re looking at a very important part of word building – suffixes.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
Suffixes. We’ll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
There’ll be a quiz…<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
So: to start off, we’re going to listen to Andrea and Steve who work in a bank. They have just interviewed two people who want to work there.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And here’s a question to think about while you listen: who did Andrea and Steve like best - the first person or the second person?<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Who did they like best? Let’s find out.<br><br> 
<b>INSERT</b><br><br> 
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
What do you think then Steve?<br><br> 
<b>Steve</b> <br>
Well, the first one was very excitable: he kept laughing and speaking fast.<br><br>
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
Perhaps it was just nervousness, but there’s no room for that in this business.<br><br>
<b>Steve</b> <br>
No. Now I thought the second interviewee seemed a bit more responsible.<br><br>
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
Yes, she did – very important when dealing with money. And she was polite.<br><br>
<b>Steve</b> <br>
Politeness is essential in this job.<br><br>
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
Absolutely. Well, I think we both know which one is more employable.<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
So, that’s Steve and Andrea. And we asked you: who did they like best?<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
And the answer is: they definitely liked the second person best. The second one was polite and responsible. The first one was a bit too excitable.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
That’s right, and excitable is a key word in the show today because it ends in a suffix.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Now in the world of vocabulary, a suffix is a group of letters that you can add to the end of a word to change its form, or meaning, or both.<br><br>  
<b>Finn</b> <br>
For example, the word excitable has the suffix -able, spelt a-b-l-e. -able makes verbs into adjectives, and we use –able words to say that a subject can do something – is able to do something - or they behave in a particular way.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
So if we take the verb excite, add the suffix -able, we can say that the first interviewee was excitable, meaning: he can get very excited.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And the second one was responsible, that’s responsible with –ible, spelt ‘i-b-l-e’. She can be trusted to do the right thing. And that’s why she was more employable, now that's -able with an a again.<br>
Now for another suffix. Andrea and Steve talked about two interviewees. The suffix –ee, spelt e-e, makes a noun which means ‘the person who receives an action’.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
For example, if you add –ee to interview, you get the person who receives an interview, an interviewee.<br><br>
<b>IDENT</b> <br>
You’re listening to BBC Learning English dot com.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And we’re talking about suffixes. Our final suffix for today is –ness, spelt n-e-s-s. Adding –ness to an adjective makes a noun.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
That’s right, and interviewee number one suffered from nervousness – the noun form of nervous.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
But number two understood the importance of politeness – the noun form of polite. Is politeness important to you Alice?<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Oh yes Finn, politeness is very important to me.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
I think you’re very polite. Now let’s listen to today’s suffixes and words again.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
The first one was: -able with an a. a-b-l-e.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
excitable, employable<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
-ible withan i. i-b-l-e.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
responsible<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
-ee: e-e<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
interviewee<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
-ness: n-e-s-s<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
nervousness, politeness<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
And it’s time for a quiz. Choose the correct suffix to complete the final words in these 2 sentences. Ready?<br>
Number 1.The most important thing to me is my family’s… <br>a) happy-ee <br>b) happy-able, <br>c) happiness.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
This one is the noun form of happy, so it’s c) happiness.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Number 2. I’m learning how to do this job. I’m a <br>a) trainee <br>b) trainable, <br>c) train-ness.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
You are receiving training, so you’re a trainee.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Well done if you got those right.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And that brings us almost to the end of today’s programme.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
But before we go, here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: if you use an online dictionary, type a hyphen or a dash into the search box, and then type in any of today’s suffixes. The dictionary will give you a list of words that end with your suffix.<br><br>

Last time, the ghost of his dead partner, Marley, told Scrooge he would be visited by three spirits. They would give him a chance of escaping Marley's fate. Scrooge was in bed when the curtains were opened and he saw a face...

                                The Spirit took Scrooge through a wall and suddenly they found themselves on an open country road. The city had disappeared. Scrooge was very excited.

                                Mr Fezziwig had the power to make us happy or unhappy; to make our work easy or hard; pleasure or pain.

Then, the young Scrooge was starting to look obsessed with money. He wasn't alone. There was a young woman by his side. Oh, she was crying...

                                It was hard for Scrooge to see how his girlfriend left him when he started to fall in love with money. But the Spirit's work wasn't done yet. He took Scrooge to yet another Christmas a few years from then. And the greedy, old man saw her happy with a husband and children - children who he almost wished were his own. Scrooge was very depressed when he got back home: the kind sister whose son he rejected, the generous employer, the lost girlfriend – that's a lot to take in! But there were still two spirits left. What would the Spirit of Christmas Present show Scrooge? Let's see it tomorrow. I can't wait!

                        There is no normal day for me at work. Some days I might be scripting or editing or filming on location. Every day tends to be slightly different.<br><br>

                        I meet some very interesting people. For example, only a month ago I was in South Africa at a town where they'd had problems with baboons inside people's homes. There was one man whose job it was to chase these baboons out of town. And to do this, he'd managed to perfectly imitate a baboon call. It worked very well.<br><br>

                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>
                        
                        I very rarely feel scared on location as we're very busy. We're too busy to feel scared. However, there have been some instances when we've been, for example, in the mountains with people we don't know very well who've had a lot to drink and we've had to leave in a hurry.<br><br>

                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>
                        
                        I can very rarely relax when I'm working. When other people who have gone on holiday or who are less busy on a film shoot can relax in the evening, they can have a glass of wine and maybe a nice, long meal. I have to go back to the hotel room and make sure everything's ok for the next day and to deal with all the pictures and video we've shot during that previous day.<br><br>

                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>
                        
                        While being on the road can be exciting and exhilarating, I am a new dad and I have a very young baby daughter at home. Not only do I miss her while I'm away a week maybe two weeks at a time but I also feel very guilty that my partner has to take full responsibility for her.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>
                        
                        Do you have a dream job?<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>
                        
                        Being a travel journalist isn't like being on holiday. It is a lot of hard work and sometimes we can be working for 14 or 15 hours at a time. However, you will get the odd occasion where you're somewhere very nice, somewhere by a beach or in the mountains with a nice view and you're waiting for a cameraman or interviewee to turn up and you can then have a look around and take in your surroundings and at that time it does feel like you have a dream job, yes.

                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
Ebenezer Scrooge woke up just before the clock struck one again. He was ready for the Spirit of Christmas Present. This time, he met his guide in the next room, which looked very different from usual. It was decorated with holly and other plants. On the table, there was a lot of delicious Christmas food like turkey, cake, fruit... Scrooge talked to the ghost.<br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
Spirit, take me where you like. Last night I learnt a lesson. Tonight, if you want to teach me, let me profit by it.<br>
<b>Narrator</b><br><br>
Oh, that's not the Scrooge we knew before. No longer arrogant?! Well, the Spirit took Scrooge to the edge of the city where his clerk Bob Cratchit lived. The man entered his humble home carrying a little boy who had a crutch and iron around his legs. His wife was preparing the meal.<br>
<b>AT BOB CRATCHIT'S HOUSE</b><br><br>
<b>Mrs Cratchit</b><br><br>
How did Tiny Tim behave at church, Robert?<br>
<b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
As good as gold! He told me on our way home that he hoped that people noticed him in the church, because he's disabled. It might be good for them to remember on Christmas Day our Lord, who made lame people walk and blind men see.<br>
<b>Narrator</b><br><br>
Tiny Tim was a sweet little boy who knew the meaning of Christmas. But he was very sick. Scrooge felt sorry for him and asked the Spirit what was going to happen.<br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.<br>
<b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
I see an empty seat in the corner, and a crutch without an owner. If things don't change in the future, the child will die.<br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
No, no. Oh, no, kind Spirit. Say he'll live!<br>
<b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
If he's going to die, he should do it, and decrease the surplus population.<br>
<b>Narrator</b><br><br>
These words caused a huge and sudden feeling of deep regret in Scrooge's heart. That was exactly what he had said earlier to the gentlemen who had asked for a donation to help the poor. If the poor died it would be good to help decrease the surplus population. Then, Scrooge heard Cratchit mention his name...<br>
<b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
After this wonderful dinner, let's raise our glasses. A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears! God bless us! And also Mr Scrooge, the Father of the Feast! Come on, dear wife!<br>
<b>Mrs Cratchit</b><br><br>
I wish I had him here, Robert. I'd give him a piece of my mind! Such a horrible, hard, unfeeling man, Mr Scrooge. I'll drink to his health because it is Christmas, but not because of him.<br>
<b>Tiny Tim</b><br><br>
God bless us every one!<br>
<b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
Thank you, Tim, my dear child.<br>
<b>Narrator</b><br><br>
There was no doubt Scrooge was the monster of the family. But if the thought of her husband's selfish boss annoyed Mrs Cratchit, it caused laughter elsewhere. The Ghost of Christmas Present took Scrooge to his nephew's house - to the Christmas dinner the old man had refused to go to.<br>
<b>AT SCROOGE'S NEPHEW'S HOUSE </b><br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br><br>
...and my uncle said that Christmas was a humbug! He's a funny man, that's the truth. And not as pleasant as he could be. However, his crimes carry their own price. His money is of no use to him. He doesn't do any good with it. He doesn't make himself comfortable with it.<br>
<b>Narrator</b><br><br>
The house was full of people dancing, playing games. The Spirit noticed that Scrooge was enjoying himself. The night was coming to an end when Scrooge saw two figures at the ghost's feet. What were they? They looked like children, but they were old and frightening. Scrooge was shocked.<br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
I'm sorry to ask but... are they yours? <br>
<b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
They are Man's creatures. The boy is Ignorance. The girl is Want. Be afraid of them both, but most of all you should fear this boy for on his face I see a terrible destiny!<br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
Don't they have a place to go?<br>
<b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?<br>
<b>Narrator</b><br><br>
Yes, once more Scrooge had his own words repeated back to him. He had always thought the poor had prisons and workhouses to go to, hadn't he? Eat your words, Mr Scrooge! Well, the bell struck twelve and that was it for the Ghost of Christmas Present. He disappeared. But the third spirit was coming. You'll hear about it next time.<br>

Hi again. I'm Emma.<br><br>

I had a real problem today deciding what to wear.<br><br>

I wanted to wear something smart for work but I'm going out with my friends tonight so I wanted to wear something casual as well.<br><br>

I usually wear a skirt, a shirt and a scarf but today, I chose jeans and a jumper. Hmm... but then I thought I look too scruffy, so I'm wearing this dress instead.<br><br>

What do you think?

                            Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come couldn't have been more different from the Spirit of Christmas Present Scrooge had just seen disappearing. It was very tall and it was hidden in a black cape and hood. It didn't speak at all. Scrooge was getting used to the company of ghosts by now but he was afraid of this one.<br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Ghost of the Future, I am more afraid of you than any spirit I've seen. But I know your purpose is to do me good. And I hope to become another man from the one I was, so I am prepared to be in your company. And do it with a thankful heart.<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Was Scrooge really changing his ways? They went to the financial district and the Spirit stopped near a group of businessmen who were chatting.<br><br>
                            <b>Businessman 1</b><br><br>
                            I don't know much about it. I only know he's dead. It's likely to be a very cheap funeral! I'm certain I don't know of anybody who'll go to it. Should we volunteer?<br><br>
                            <b>Businessman 2</b><br><br>
                            I don't mind going if a lunch is provided! What happened to the money?<br><br>
                            <b>Businessman 1</b><br><br>
                            Well, he didn't give it to me!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Scrooge knew these men. But why did the Spirit make him listen to this conversation? No answer. Then the Spirit took him to a bad part of town. Criminals lived there. Some people were trying to sell stolen goods and they were making fun of the person who used to own them.<br><br>
                            <b>Housekeeper</b><br><br>
                            Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose. He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive, but he profits us now he's dead!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And even the shirt the dead man was wearing was sold. A Housekeeper, a laundress, an undertaker - they stood in line to make a profit on the dead man's things. Scrooge was shocked! He asked the Ghost to show him people with kindness towards the dead. And where do you think they went? Scrooge found himself back at Bob Cratchit's house. But this time everybody was sad and quiet. Bob Cratchit had just returned from church where he had made arrangements for somebody's funeral.<br><br>
                            <b>Mrs Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            How was it, Robert?<br><br>
                            <b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            I wish you could have been there, dear wife. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child...<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Scrooge knew now that Tiny Tim was dead. But who was that man whose death others were talking about? The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come took Scrooge to a graveyard and pointed ahead. On the stone of a neglected grave, the old man read a name: Ebenezer Scrooge! It was his own name! It was Scrooge's grave!<br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            No, Spirit. Oh no, no! Spirit, hear me. I'm not the man I was. Why show me this, if all hope is gone?<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Wow! That's a brand new Scrooge we're seeing! And he's not done yet in his pleading...<br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Good Spirit, tell me that I still may change these shadows you have shown me, by changing my life. I will celebrate Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I'll live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall live within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me that I may remove the writing on this stone!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Scrooge grabbed the Spirit's hand. The Spirit tried to free itself. In the end, it just disappeared. Scrooge found himself grabbing his own bedpost. What will happen now? I'll tell you next time.<br><br>

                        In the afternoon Scrooge went to his nephew's house for that dinner he was invited to but didn't want to go to. Do you remember that? How will his nephew react?<br><br>

                        His nephew received him with open arms. And what a party it was! It was great to be in that same party the Spirit of Christmas Present had shown him before. And this time everybody could see Scrooge and talk to him. The next morning, the old man went to the office very early to catch Bob Cratchit coming late. Eighteen and a half minutes late!<br><br>

                        Scrooge did it all, and much, much more. He became a second father to Tiny Tim, who did not die, and a good friend to all. Some people laughed to see how he'd changed, but he let them laugh. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. It was always said of Scrooge, that he knew how to keep the Christmas cheer alive and well. I hope we do the same. Tiny Tim has the last word:<br><br>

                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            So let's get started - with a conversation. Mike and Sarah are getting ready to go to a party, but they have very different ideas about what Mike should wear.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            While you listen, try to answer this question. What does Mike wear to the party?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Let's find out.<br><br>
                            
                            
                            <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                            You're not seriously going to the party dressed like that! You'll be the most scruffily-dressed man there.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                            The invitation said casual, so I'm dressing casually: jeans and a T-shirt. What's wrong with that?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                            It's too scruffy: the invitation said smart-casual. You need to wear something much smarter, Mike.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                            What, a suit?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                            No, that's too formal - it's not a job interview. Just wear a nice fashionable shirt.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                            But I hate fashion. I can't dress fashionably. I'm the most unfashionable person I know.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                            Well, you'll be the only one in a T-shirt.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                            OK, you win. I'll wear my black shirt and the smart shoes. But I'm still wearing my jeans.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Sarah</b><br><br>

                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            So, did you hear what Mike wore to the party in the end?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            He wore a black shirt, jeans, and his smart shoes.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            Well done if you got that right. Now, let's take a closer look at some of the fashion-related vocabulary we heard there - starting with some of the adjectives.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Yes and of course adjectives are words which describe nouns, and there were lots of adjectives describing people and their clothes. Sarah thinks Mike is scruffy.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            Which means not neat or clean.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            But Mike wants to be casual.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            Informal and comfortable.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            She thinks he should be smart.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            Nice and stylish.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            But not too formal.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            Old-fashioned and serious.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            And she wants him to wear something fashionable.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            New and stylish.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Now, we can change these words into adverbs - words that describe verbs. And Mike and Sarah used lots of adverbs to describe the way people dress. We heard: scruffily, casually, smartly, formally and fashionably.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            And because they are adverbs, they all end in the letters 'l-y'. Here are some clips from the conversation. Listen out for adverbs which describe the verb dress.<br><br>
                            
                            You'll be the most scruffily-dressed man there.<br><br>
                            
                            So I'm dressing casually. Jeans and a T-shirt.<br><br>
                            
                            I can't dress fashionably.<br><br>
                                                        
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            And coming up soon is our vocabulary quiz: but first, let's have a quick recap of today's fashion-related vocabulary.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            First we had some adjectives.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Scruffy, casual, smart, formal, fashionable.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            And then we looked at some adverbs.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Scruffily, casually, smartly, formally, fashionably.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            And now: it's quiz time. All you have to do is finish the sentences with words from today's programme. There are two sentences, each with three choices. So, are we ready?

                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            The answer is: b) fashionable.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                            That's right. Now, question 2. I had a job interview yesterday, so I dressed very: a) formally b) scruffy c) formal.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            It's: a) formally.<br><br>

                            To help you remember how to use adjectives and adverbs, it's a really good idea to write down example sentences.<br><br>

                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Hello. This is the story of an ordinary girl called Alice. Our story begins on an ordinary summer's day. Let's meet Alice: here she is, sitting next to the river with her sister on a very hot summer's afternoon. Her sister is reading a book, and with no-one to talk to, Alice is bored… and a bit sleepy. Soon, she'll be in a Wonderland full of strange and wonderful adventures… but Alice doesn't know that yet…<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ohh… There's nothing to do… except lie on the grass and pick daisies. Shall I make a daisy chain for my dear little Dinah? Oh… I don't know… it's sooo hot…  <br><br>
                            
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm late! I'm so very late! Oh dear oh dear!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            A white rabbit! A talking white rabbit? Perhaps. But a rabbit with a pocket-watch? A rabbit with pockets? I must see where he's going!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice had never seen a rabbit with a pocket, or a waistcoat, or a pocket-watch before. So, she ran after the rabbit as fast as she could, and when the rabbit jumped down a large rabbit hole, Alice jumped straight after him.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oohhhh… Either this hole is very deep or I'm falling very slowly. And what a curious rabbit-hole! Who would think a rabbit-hole would have bookshelves… and books … and maps … and jars of marmalade?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice fell down, down, down. She fell for so long that she began to think about Dinah, her cat.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Dinah will miss me tonight!I hope they'll remember her milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice was beginning to feel quite sleepy when suddenly, her fall was over and she found herself sitting on a pile of leaves and grass. <br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ouch! Who's there?<br><br>
                            
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh, my ears and whiskers! How late it's getting!!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Wait! Please sir, wait a moment!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            The White Rabbit ran down a long tunnel. Alice ran after him. But when she reached the end of the tunnel she found only a long hall with doors all the way round. Alice tried to open the doors – but they were all locked. Then she saw a table with a tiny key on it.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            These doors are all too big. There must be a smaller door somewhere. I wonder… hmmm, let me look behind this little curtain… ooh! a tiny little door! Let me try the key... What a beautiful garden! But how can I visit it? The door is so tiny – I can't even fit my head through! Oh! It's no use. I wish I could fold up like a telescope! Wait a minute… what's this? It certainly wasn't here before. A bottle – I wonder what it is. Let me see the label. Hmmm: Drink me… Oh! Oh! Ohhhhhh!!!! What a curious feeling! I'm folding up like a telescope!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And so she was! Alice got smaller and smaller until she was small enough to fit through the door. But she'd forgotten something …<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            The key!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice was too small to reach the key on the table. She tried and tried to climb up the table leg but it was too slippery. When she had tired herself out with trying, poor little Alice sat down and cried.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            It's no use. I can't reach the key, so I can't get into the garden and that's that. There's no use crying like that! (sharply) Alice! I advise you to stop this minute! … Oohh… what's this? A little glass box… with cake inside! Ooh: and there's a note. Eat me. Hmmm. I wonder if it will make me grow... if I grow, I will be able to reach the key. But what if makes me even smaller? Well, if it makes me smaller, I will be able to creep under the door.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And Alice began to eat the cake. Did she grow big enough to reach the key? Or perhaps the cake made her small enough to creep under the door and into her beautiful garden. I'll tell you what happened next time. Goodbye.

                    <p>
                      <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Sophie.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And me, Neil. Hello.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Today we’re talking about the present simple tense…<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
...and the present continuous tense. Coming up in today’s programme:<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
We’ll take a look at positives, negatives, and question forms…<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
We’ll find out when to use each tense…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
We’ll hear some short forms…<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And we’ll have a quiz to test what we’ve learnt.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
But first: the present simple tense. We use it to talk about things that happen regularly. Here’s Finn with an example:<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
John checks his email every morning.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Thanks Finn. So the verb to check is in the present simple – John checks - because he checks his email regularly – every morning.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
We make the present simple with a subject plus a base verb – I check, you go, we live, they wear.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
For he, she and it, add an s to the verb. Can you demonstrate please Finn?<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
I always we­ar a coat in the winter. My brother wears a jacket.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Now we also use the present simple to talk about facts and permanent situations. So we can say…<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
I work in the fashion industry. My sister lives in China.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
To make the present simple negative, use don’t or doesn’t. And there’s no s on the end of the verb. Finn?<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
I don’t work in the modelling industry. My brother doesn’t like fashion.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
For questions, use do or does.<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
Do your friends live in London? Does John check his email in the morning?<br><br>

<b>STING</b>
<br><br>
<b>Neil</b><br><br>
So that’s present simple. Now: let’s look at the present continuous tense. [SFX: phone rings] Ooh just a minute, let me get that… [to caller] Hello? Sorry, I’m working at the moment. Can I call you back? Sorry about that everyone…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
[bemused] No problem…<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
So: I just said I’m working at the moment.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Aha! A clever demonstration!<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
That’s right – I said I’m working at the moment, because it’s an activity that’s happening now. I can say I work at the BBC in the present simple because my job is a permanent situation. But right now at this moment I’m doing the activity of working, so I use present continuous to say I’m working at the moment.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Right. As well as activities, we use the present continuous tense for temporary situations like this:<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
My parents are staying with me this week. I’m sleeping on the sofa.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Ok. To make the present continuous, use am, is or are plus an i-n-g verb.<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
I’m checking my email at the moment. Emily’s wearing a pink hat today. They’re eating dinner now.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And did you hear those short forms? The words I am are shortened to I’m…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Emily is sounds like Emily’s.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And they are sounds like they’re. We’ll have short forms in just a moment.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And today we’re talking about the present simple tense…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
… and the present continuous.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Let’s look at present continuous negatives. We make them with the little word <b>not</b>.<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
I’m not wearing a raincoat because it isn’t raining.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
And here are those short forms again:<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
I am not becomes…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
… I’m not.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Is not…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
… isn’t<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And for are not we get…<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
… aren’t.<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
I’m not wearing shoes. He isn’t working today. You aren’t watching television.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Umm Neil, are you sending an email?<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Errr - yes… [slightly bewildered] What are we doing? Are we talking about questions?<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Yes, we are.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Ooh, sorry – Back to the programme!<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Aha! Another clever demonstration! I said: Are you sending an email?<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And I said: Are we talking about questions?<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
And of course, we both asked present continuous yes/no questions.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And to make them, you just change the word order. Instead of You are sending an email, it’s Are you sending an email?<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
And change We are talking about questions to Are we talking about questions?<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
It’s fine to put question words like why or what at the start of the question.<br><br>

<b>Finn</b><br><br>
What are we doing? Why are you sending an email?<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
So that’s present continuous questions.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
So that means: it’s time for a quiz. Join in if you like. I’m going to say a sentence and you need to make it negative. Neil will give the answer. Ready? Number 1. Paolo speaks Chinese.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Paolo doesn’t speak Chinese.<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
Now make this sentence into a yes/no question: The children are playing a game.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Are the children playing a game?<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
And one more: this time, make a present continuous question starting with why. Simon is learning Japanese.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
Why is Simon learning Japanese?<br><br>

<b>Sophie</b><br><br>
And that’s the end of the quiz – well done if you got them all right.<br><br>

<b>Neil</b><br><br>
And that’s also the end of the programme – but there’s more about these tenses on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.<br><br>

                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Hello! Alice is having some very curious adventures at the bottom of a rabbit hole. She drank a drink that made her very small indeed. But she wants to grow bigger so that she can reach the key that will unlock the tiny door to a beautiful garden. After eating some cake she found in a little glass box, Alice started to feel something …<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Curiouser and curiouser! I'm growing! My feet are so far away. Goodbye feet! How will I put my shoes and socks on, I wonder? Ouch!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice grew so big that her head hit the ceiling! It was easy to reach the table now. She picked up the tiny key and rushed to the door. But in her excitement, she forgot something again…<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ohhhh… this is hopeless! I'm much too big for this door now! I'll never get into the garden! I can only look through the door with one eye! Oh…<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice was over nine feet tall, and when a girl that big cries, the tears are big too. Alice cried and cried until half the hall was filledwith a salty pool of tears. After a time, Alice heard a little pattering of feet in the distance. She dried her eyes to see what was coming.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh! I'm late! I'm so very late! I was told to be early and I'm going to be late. The Duchess will be waiting. Oh my! Oh my! She will be so very angry with me! Oh my!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            The sight of The White Rabbit, splendidly dressed in his best clothes, and carrying a large fan and a pair of white leather gloves was enough to stop Alice's tears.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            If you please, sir…<br><br>
                            
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh!! Oh my!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Don't go! I won't hurt – Oh dear! You've dropped your gloves… But look: what a pretty fan. And crying is such hot work. Oh, that's better. Oh dear… how strange everything is today. Yesterday things were normal. But today I'm not sure if I am the same girl who woke up this morning. But, if I'm not the girl who woke up this morning, the question is, "Who am I?"<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice fanned herself while she talked. She felt much cooler. But after a minute or two, something started happening.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oh: Here's that feeling again.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Then something kept happening. Alice kept fanning herself.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            I don't believe it. I must be… I am! I'm growing smaller again. Smaller than the table. Hello feet! It's good to see you again.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Soon Alice was smaller than ever. She was still shrinking and shrinking and she didn't know why.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oh dear - I'm getting very small. Oh… I'm getting much too small! Oh dear - I shall fade away altogether! Ohh…! The fan? The fan!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Just in time. Alice threw the fan on the floor, so she wouldn't get any smaller.  <br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            That was a lucky escape! But now I'm small enough to get into the garden!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Poor Alice! There she stood at the little door - but it was locked again. And there was the little key, back in its place, out of reach, on the table.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oh not again! This is hopeless. I'll never get that key now. I so badly wanted to see the garden. And things are worse than ever - I've never been so small as this in my life. Never!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Things were as bad as ever. And they were about to get worse...<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ohhh!<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And poor little Alice fell into a pool of her own tears. Luckily, she knew how to swim. But she wasn't the only one who had fallen into the pool. Next time, Alice meets a dodo, tries to make friends with a mouse, and joins in a very, very curious race. Goodbye.
