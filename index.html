                        Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some information about the class. <br><br> Our
                        class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13. <br><br>We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes,
                        so we finish at 6 p.m. That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK? <br><br> Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office 7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions
                        or problems or want to talk to me, it's Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.<br><br> We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.<br><br> I think
                        that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to see any photocopies of the book, thank you!
                        Remember, it's level 1 student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book. <br><br>I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!

                                <br> This is a tricky one. I can't pick one person. I'd have to say my family.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think like a lot of people I'd probably say my mum. She's my rock and my best friend.

                                <br> Rollercoasters. I'm absolutely terrified of being upside down.

                                <br> Dentists. I scream like a baby.

                                <br> My turn. Question three: How do you take your coffee?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> It's never just coffee. I prefer cappuccinos, darling!
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I'm more of a typical British tea drinker. If I do have a coffee I usually have an Americano with cold milk. Cold milk is very important.
Can I do another one? Question four: When did you last cry?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> When I became an uncle.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think mine was the last time I went to see a musical. The show was so beautiful I was moved to tears.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Question five: Are you feeling excited?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Yes! It's really exciting to be here and I'm quite an excitable person.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br>Yes, very excited.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br>OK, question six. This comes in three parts. Do you speak another language?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Yes, I have attempted to learn several languages.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Which ones?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Bengali, Hindi and Urdu are my strongest and I'm learning Farsi and French.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I've studied French and Mandarin and Japanese, but I'm not very good at any of them.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> And can you sing a song in French?
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> How about Frere Jacque? (Sings) Come on Amith - your turn.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> OK, a song in Hindi (Sings).
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> That was lovely Amith! I think that's all we've got time for with questions. I think we know each other a little better now.

                        Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        And me, Sophie. Hello. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Today’s programme is all about questions. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes: we’ll take a look at different types of yes-no questions… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        We’ll hear lots of w-h questions… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And we’ll be using the questions to get to know each other a little bit better.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        So if you want a reminder of English question forms… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Or if you’re if you’re studying them for the first time… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Keep listening and join in with the task we’ll be giving you later on. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        So let’s get started. 
                        In English, there are two basic question types: <b>yes/no questions</b> and <b>w-h questions.</b> <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And here’s Finn with our first yes-no question: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Can you speak English? Can you speak English? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Thanks Finn. That’s a useful first question. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, and it’s made with the auxiliary verb <b>can</b>, plus the subject you</b> and a verb: speak.</b> Can you 
                        speak? Can you speak English Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Yes, I can. Another question please Finn? <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Do you work every day? Do you work every day? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb <b>work.</b> Do you work every day, Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I don't, no. I don't work at weekends. Finn? <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Do you have any brothers and sisters? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb: <b>have</b>. Neil, do you have any brothers or sisters? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Yes I do I've got one sister. Now another way to make yes-no questions is with the verb <b>to be</b> plus a subject. Let’s demonstrate. Sophie: Are you married? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        No, Neil, I’m not. Is your boss married? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        My boss? No, he isn't. Were you in the office yesterday? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, sadly I was in the office yesterday. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And we're talking about question forms.  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now the second main type of question in English starts with either <b>what</b>, <b>where</b>, <b>when</b>, <b>which</b>, 
                        <b>why</b>, <b>who</b>, or the odd one out: <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        … <b>how.</b> <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        So let’s try making a question with <b>where.</b> We add an auxiliary… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        … such as <b>do</b> <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        … then we can add a subject plus a verb. For example: Neil: Where do you live? Where do you 
                        live? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I live in south London. Where do you live Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        I live in north London. Now let’s change the question word and the verb. Which languages 
                        do you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And here we add a noun to <b>which:</b> Which languages do you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Just English. And with a different auxiliary: Which languages can you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        We can add nouns to some of the other question words: What time do you start work? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        About 9 o'clock in the morning. And if we ask What time is it? We’re making a <b>w-h</b> question 
                        with the verb <b>to be.</b> I can ask: Where were you born? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I was born in England. When is your birthday? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        In September. What is your work address? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        It's W1A. Lots of useful questions with <b>to be</b> there. Now for a very personal question with 
                        <b>to be</b>: Sophie: How old are you? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        You should never ask a woman her age! And for questions with <b>how</b>, we usually add an 
                        extra word. To ask about age it’s: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How old… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        For price it’s: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How much… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        For size we ask: <br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How big… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And for height it’s  <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How tall.  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        How tall are you, Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        About 180cm. And of course, you can’t answer a <b>w-h</b> question with <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> How tall are 
                        you, Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        I think we're actually the same height.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Let me see, back to back… No, I'm taller! 
                        Is it time for a practice task Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, it is. Join in at home if you like. I’m going to give you a topic to ask me about, and you 
                        have to make one <b>yes/no</b> question and one <b>w-h</b> question. And Neil will give some possible 
                        answers. Here’s the first topic: Ask me about my age. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b>: <br>
                        Ok so you could ask: How old are you? When were you born? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now ask me about my home. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Do you live with your family? What is your address? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now ask me about my work. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Do you work near here? How much do you earn? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Thanks Neil. And well done to you at home if you joined in with the task.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        So that’s a look at some basic question types we can use when we’re getting to know 
                        people. We had <b>yes/no</b> questions...  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And we looked at questions starting with <b>w-h</b> words.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And we found out some interesting information about each other. I didn’t know how tall 
                        you were, Sophie?! <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I know, it's quite amazing really. And there’s lots more about questions forms on our

                                <b>Narrator</b><br>
This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who loved money and didn't like Christmas. There he was, on Christmas Eve, in his office. He was keeping an eye on his clerk Bob Cratchit. Scrooge wanted to get every little bit of work from Cratchit before allowing him to spend Christmas Day at home. Scrooge thought Christmas was a waste of time! Even his nephew couldn't convince him that it wasn't. <br><br>
<b>IN SCROOGE'S OFFICE</b><br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
A Merry Christmas, uncle!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Bah! Humbug!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
You don't mean that, I'm sure!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money? You find yourself a year older, but not an hour richer! What good has it ever done you?<br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
I've always thought of Christmas as a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time. A time when men and women seem to open their hearts freely. It's never put money in my pocket, but I believe that it's done me good!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Humbug!<br><br>
<b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
Come on, uncle, come and have dinner with us tomorrow.<br><br>
<b>Narrator</b><br>
Scrooge's nephew was persistent but the old man wouldn't change his mind. He was in his usual bad mood when two gentlemen came to his office to ask for a donation to offer Christmas dinner to the poor. Scrooge worked in the money-lending business. No donation from him...<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Gentlemen, are there no prisons and workhouses, where the poor receive food and accommodation in return for some work?<br><br>
<b>Gentleman</b><br>
We wish we could say there aren't any, Mr Scrooge. Many poor people would rather die than go to prison or the...<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
They should die and decrease the surplus population. And... well, it's none of my business anyway. They cost a lot of money, and the poor should go there. Goodbye, sir.<br><br>
<b>Narrator</b><br>
Typical Scrooge! He feels sorry for no-one, helps no-one. With him, it's all about money. He thought of nothing else. His partner, Jacob Marley, had died seven years before, at Christmas. Marley was like Scrooge when he was alive. But now he was gone. Or was he?<br><br>
<b>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE </b><br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Who's there? I'm finally home and I want some peace!<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
Scroooge... Scrooooooge...<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
What is this? A ghost?! It's not possible! I must be having indigestion and seeing things that aren't there!<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
Scrooge. In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.<br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Marley, is it really you?! And what is this strange metal chain you are wearing? It's made of cash-boxes, keys, locks, heavy purses...<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
I wear the chain I made in life. Of my own free will I wore it when I was alive. Is its pattern strange to you? Or do you wish to know the weight and length of the heavy chain you are carrying yourself? <br><br>
<b>Scrooge</b><br>
Don't say that, Jacob. And why is this happening to you? You were always a good man of business…<br><br>
<b>Marley</b><br>
Business!? Mankind was my business. Charity, kindness - were all my business. Why did I walk through crowds of people with my eyes turned down? I'm here to warn you, that you still have a chance of escaping my fate. You'll be visited by three spirits. Expect the first spirit tomorrow at one o'clock in the morning. And remember what I've told you.<br><br>
<b>Narrator</b><br>
Marley disappeared into the night, flying out of an open window with other ghosts which looked as miserable as him. Scrooge was shocked. I'll tell you about the visit of the first spirit next time<br>

                    <p>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn...<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
And I’m Alice. Today we’re looking at a very important part of word building – suffixes.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
Suffixes. We’ll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
There’ll be a quiz…<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
So: to start off, we’re going to listen to Andrea and Steve who work in a bank. They have just interviewed two people who want to work there.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And here’s a question to think about while you listen: who did Andrea and Steve like best - the first person or the second person?<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Who did they like best? Let’s find out.<br><br> 
<b>INSERT</b><br><br> 
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
What do you think then Steve?<br><br> 
<b>Steve</b> <br>
Well, the first one was very excitable: he kept laughing and speaking fast.<br><br>
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
Perhaps it was just nervousness, but there’s no room for that in this business.<br><br>
<b>Steve</b> <br>
No. Now I thought the second interviewee seemed a bit more responsible.<br><br>
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
Yes, she did – very important when dealing with money. And she was polite.<br><br>
<b>Steve</b> <br>
Politeness is essential in this job.<br><br>
<b>Andrea</b> <br>
Absolutely. Well, I think we both know which one is more employable.<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
So, that’s Steve and Andrea. And we asked you: who did they like best?<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
And the answer is: they definitely liked the second person best. The second one was polite and responsible. The first one was a bit too excitable.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
That’s right, and excitable is a key word in the show today because it ends in a suffix.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Now in the world of vocabulary, a suffix is a group of letters that you can add to the end of a word to change its form, or meaning, or both.<br><br>  
<b>Finn</b> <br>
For example, the word excitable has the suffix -able, spelt a-b-l-e. -able makes verbs into adjectives, and we use –able words to say that a subject can do something – is able to do something - or they behave in a particular way.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
So if we take the verb excite, add the suffix -able, we can say that the first interviewee was excitable, meaning: he can get very excited.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And the second one was responsible, that’s responsible with –ible, spelt ‘i-b-l-e’. She can be trusted to do the right thing. And that’s why she was more employable, now that's -able with an a again.<br>
Now for another suffix. Andrea and Steve talked about two interviewees. The suffix –ee, spelt e-e, makes a noun which means ‘the person who receives an action’.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
For example, if you add –ee to interview, you get the person who receives an interview, an interviewee.<br><br>
<b>IDENT</b> <br>
You’re listening to BBC Learning English dot com.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And we’re talking about suffixes. Our final suffix for today is –ness, spelt n-e-s-s. Adding –ness to an adjective makes a noun.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
That’s right, and interviewee number one suffered from nervousness – the noun form of nervous.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
But number two understood the importance of politeness – the noun form of polite. Is politeness important to you Alice?<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Oh yes Finn, politeness is very important to me.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
I think you’re very polite. Now let’s listen to today’s suffixes and words again.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
The first one was: -able with an a. a-b-l-e.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
excitable, employable<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
-ible withan i. i-b-l-e.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
responsible<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
-ee: e-e<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
interviewee<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
-ness: n-e-s-s<br><br> 
<b>Finn</b> <br>
nervousness, politeness<br><br> 
<b>Alice</b> <br>
And it’s time for a quiz. Choose the correct suffix to complete the final words in these 2 sentences. Ready?<br>
Number 1.The most important thing to me is my family’s… <br>a) happy-ee <br>b) happy-able, <br>c) happiness.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
This one is the noun form of happy, so it’s c) happiness.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Number 2. I’m learning how to do this job. I’m a <br>a) trainee <br>b) trainable, <br>c) train-ness.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
You are receiving training, so you’re a trainee.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
Well done if you got those right.<br><br>
<b>Finn</b> <br>
And that brings us almost to the end of today’s programme.<br><br>
<b>Alice</b> <br>
But before we go, here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: if you use an online dictionary, type a hyphen or a dash into the search box, and then type in any of today’s suffixes. The dictionary will give you a list of words that end with your suffix.<br><br>

Last time, the ghost of his dead partner, Marley, told Scrooge he would be visited by three spirits. They would give him a chance of escaping Marley's fate. Scrooge was in bed when the curtains were opened and he saw a face...

Then, the young Scrooge was starting to look obsessed with money. He wasn't alone. There was a young woman by his side. Oh, she was crying...

                                It was hard for Scrooge to see how his girlfriend left him when he started to fall in love with money. But the Spirit's work wasn't done yet. He took Scrooge to yet another Christmas a few years from then. And the greedy, old man saw her happy with a husband and children - children who he almost wished were his own. Scrooge was very depressed when he got back home: the kind sister whose son he rejected, the generous employer, the lost girlfriend – that's a lot to take in! But there were still two spirits left. What would the Spirit of Christmas Present show Scrooge? Let's see it tomorrow. I can't wait!
