                        Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some information about the class. <br><br> Our
                        class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13. <br><br>We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes,
                        so we finish at 6 p.m. That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK? <br><br> Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office 7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions
                        or problems or want to talk to me, it's Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.<br><br> We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.<br><br> I think
                        that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to see any photocopies of the book, thank you!
                        Remember, it's level 1 student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book. <br><br>I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!</p>

                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> This is a tricky one. I can't pick one person. I'd have to say my family.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think like a lot of people I'd probably say my mum. She's my rock and my best friend.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> My turn. Question two: What makes you scream?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Rollercoasters. I'm absolutely terrified of being upside down.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Dentists. I scream like a baby.  
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> My turn. Question three: How do you take your coffee?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> It's never just coffee. I prefer cappuccinos, darling!
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I'm more of a typical British tea drinker. If I do have a coffee I usually have an Americano with cold milk. Cold milk is very important.
Can I do another one? Question four: When did you last cry?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> When I became an uncle.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think mine was the last time I went to see a musical. The show was so beautiful I was moved to tears.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Question five: Are you feeling excited?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Yes! It's really exciting to be here and I'm quite an excitable person.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br>Yes, very excited.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br>OK, question six. This comes in three parts. Do you speak another language?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Yes, I have attempted to learn several languages.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Which ones?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Bengali, Hindi and Urdu are my strongest and I'm learning Farsi and French.
                                
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I've studied French and Mandarin and Japanese, but I'm not very good at any of them.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> And can you sing a song in French?
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> How about Frere Jacque? (Sings) Come on Amith - your turn.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> OK, a song in Hindi (Sings).
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> That was lovely Amith! I think that's all we've got time for with questions. I think we know each other a little better now.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I think we do!
