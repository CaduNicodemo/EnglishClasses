                        Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some information about the class. <br><br> Our
                        class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13. <br><br>We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes,
                        so we finish at 6 p.m. That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK? <br><br> Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office 7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions
                        or problems or want to talk to me, it's Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.<br><br> We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.<br><br> I think
                        that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to see any photocopies of the book, thank you!
                        Remember, it's level 1 student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book. <br><br>I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!

                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> This is a tricky one. I can't pick one person. I'd have to say my family.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think like a lot of people I'd probably say my mum. She's my rock and my best friend.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> My turn. Question two: What makes you scream?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Rollercoasters. I'm absolutely terrified of being upside down.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Dentists. I scream like a baby.  
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> My turn. Question three: How do you take your coffee?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> It's never just coffee. I prefer cappuccinos, darling!
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I'm more of a typical British tea drinker. If I do have a coffee I usually have an Americano with cold milk. Cold milk is very important.
Can I do another one? Question four: When did you last cry?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> When I became an uncle.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think mine was the last time I went to see a musical. The show was so beautiful I was moved to tears.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Question five: Are you feeling excited?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Yes! It's really exciting to be here and I'm quite an excitable person.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br>Yes, very excited.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br>OK, question six. This comes in three parts. Do you speak another language?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Yes, I have attempted to learn several languages.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Which ones?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Bengali, Hindi and Urdu are my strongest and I'm learning Farsi and French.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I've studied French and Mandarin and Japanese, but I'm not very good at any of them.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> And can you sing a song in French?
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> How about Frere Jacque? (Sings) Come on Amith - your turn.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> OK, a song in Hindi (Sings).
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> That was lovely Amith! I think that's all we've got time for with questions. I think we know each other a little better now.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I think we do!

                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        And me, Sophie. Hello.
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Today’s programme is all about questions.
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Yes: we’ll take a look at different types of yes-no questions…
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        We’ll hear lots of w-h questions…
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        And we’ll be using the questions to get to know each other a little bit better. 
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        So if you want a reminder of English question forms…
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Or if you’re if you’re studying them for the first time…
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Keep listening and join in with the task we’ll be giving you later on.
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        So let’s get started. 
                        In English, there are two basic question types: <b>yes/no questions</b> and <b>w-h questions.</b>
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        And here’s Finn with our first yes-no question:
                        <b>Finn
                        Can you speak English? Can you speak English?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Thanks Finn. That’s a useful first question.
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Yes, and it’s made with the auxiliary verb <b>can</b>, plus the subject you</b> and a verb: speak.</b> Can you 
                        speak? Can you speak English Neil?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Yes, I can. Another question please Finn?
                        <b>Finn</b>
                        Do you work every day? Do you work every day?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb <b>work.</b> Do you work every day, Neil?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        I don't, no. I don't work at weekends. Finn?
                        <b>Finn</b>
                        Do you have any brothers and sisters?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb: <b>have</b>. Neil, do you have any brothers or sisters?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Yes I do I've got one sister. Now another way to make yes-no questions is with the verb <b>to be</b> plus a subject. Let’s demonstrate. Sophie: Are you married?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        No, Neil, I’m not. Is your boss married?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        My boss? No, he isn't. Were you in the office yesterday?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Yes, sadly I was in the office yesterday.
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        And we're talking about question forms. 
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Now the second main type of question in English starts with either <b>what</b>, <b>where</b>, <b>when</b>, <b>which</b>, 
                        <b>why</b>, <b>who</b>, or the odd one out:
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        … <b>how.</b>
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        So let’s try making a question with <b>where.</b> We add an auxiliary…
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        … such as <b>do</b>
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        … then we can add a subject plus a verb. For example: Neil: Where do you live? Where do you 
                        live?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        I live in south London. Where do you live Sophie?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        I live in north London. Now let’s change the question word and the verb. Which languages 
                        do you speak? 
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        And here we add a noun to <b>which:</b> Which languages do you speak? 
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Just English. And with a different auxiliary: Which languages can you speak? 
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        We can add nouns to some of the other question words: What time do you start work?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        About 9 o'clock in the morning. And if we ask What time is it? We’re making a <b>w-h</b> question 
                        with the verb <b>to be.</b> I can ask: Where were you born?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        I was born in England. When is your birthday?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        In September. What is your work address?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        It's W1A. Lots of useful questions with <b>to be</b> there. Now for a very personal question with 
                        <b>to be</b>: Sophie: How old are you?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        You should never ask a woman her age! And for questions with <b>how</b>, we usually add an 
                        extra word. To ask about age it’s:
                        <b>Finn</b>
                        How old…
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        For price it’s:
                        <b>Finn</b>
                        How much…
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        For size we ask: 
                        <b>Finn</b>
                        How big…
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        And for height it’s 
                        <b>Finn</b>
                        How tall. 
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        How tall are you, Neil?
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        About 180cm. And of course, you can’t answer a <b>w-h</b> question with <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> How tall are 
                        you, Sophie?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        I think we're actually the same height. 
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Let me see, back to back… No, I'm taller! 
                        Is it time for a practice task Sophie?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Yes, it is. Join in at home if you like. I’m going to give you a topic to ask me about, and you 
                        have to make one <b>yes/no</b> question and one <b>w-h</b> question. And Neil will give some possible 
                        answers. Here’s the first topic: Ask me about my age.
                        <b>Neil</b>:
                        Ok so you could ask: How old are you? When were you born?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Now ask me about my home.
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Do you live with your family? What is your address?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Now ask me about my work.
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        Do you work near here? How much do you earn?
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        Thanks Neil. And well done to you at home if you joined in with the task. 
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        So that’s a look at some basic question types we can use when we’re getting to know 
                        people. We had <b>yes/no</b> questions, 
                        <b>Sophie</b>
                        And we looked at questions starting with <b>w-h</b> words. 
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        And we found out some interesting information about each other. I didn’t know how tall 
                        you were, Sophie?!
                        <b>Neil</b>
                        I know, it's quite amazing really. And there’s lots more about questions forms on our

                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Hey, I'm Sophie
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> And I'm Amith. Alright? OK, question one: Who do you love most in the world?
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> This is a tricky one. I can't pick one person. I'd have to say my family.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think like a lot of people I'd probably say my mum. She's my rock and my best friend.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> My turn. Question two: What makes you scream?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Rollercoasters. I'm absolutely terrified of being upside down.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Dentists. I scream like a baby.  
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> My turn. Question three: How do you take your coffee?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> It's never just coffee. I prefer cappuccinos, darling!
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I'm more of a typical British tea drinker. If I do have a coffee I usually have an Americano with cold milk. Cold milk is very important.
Can I do another one? Question four: When did you last cry?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> When I became an uncle.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> I think mine was the last time I went to see a musical. The show was so beautiful I was moved to tears.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Question five: Are you feeling excited?
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Yes! It's really exciting to be here and I'm quite an excitable person.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br>Yes, very excited.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br>OK, question six. This comes in three parts. Do you speak another language?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Yes, I have attempted to learn several languages.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> Which ones?
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> Bengali, Hindi and Urdu are my strongest and I'm learning Farsi and French.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I've studied French and Mandarin and Japanese, but I'm not very good at any of them.
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> And can you sing a song in French?
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> How about Frere Jacque? (Sings) Come on Amith - your turn.
                                <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                                <br> OK, a song in Hindi (Sings).
                                <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                                <br> That was lovely Amith! I think that's all we've got time for with questions. I think we know each other a little better now.
                                <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                                <br> I think we do!      
                            </p>
