                        Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some information about the class. <br><br> Our
                        class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13. <br><br>We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes,
                        so we finish at 6 p.m. That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK? <br><br> Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office 7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions
                        or problems or want to talk to me, it's Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.<br><br> We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.<br><br> I think
                        that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to see any photocopies of the book, thank you!
                        Remember, it's level 1 student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book. <br><br>I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!

                            <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                            <br> This is a tricky one. I can't pick one person. I'd have to say my family.
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> I think like a lot of people I'd probably say my mum. She's my rock and my best friend.

                            <br> My turn. Question two: What makes you scream?
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> Rollercoasters. I'm absolutely terrified of being upside down.
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> Dentists. I scream like a baby.  
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> My turn. Question three: How do you take your coffee?
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> It's never just coffee. I prefer cappuccinos, darling!
                            <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                            <br> I'm more of a typical British tea drinker. If I do have a coffee I usually have an Americano with cold milk. Cold milk is very important. Can I do another one? Question four: When did you last cry?
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> When I became an uncle.
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> I think mine was the last time I went to see a musical. The show was so beautiful I was moved to tears.
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> Question five: Are you feeling excited?
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> Yes! It's really exciting to be here and I'm quite an excitable person.
                            <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                            <br>Yes, very excited.
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br>OK, question six. This comes in three parts. Do you speak another language?
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> Yes, I have attempted to learn several languages.
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> Which ones?
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> Bengali, Hindi and Urdu are my strongest and I'm learning Farsi and French.
                            <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                            <br> I've studied French and Mandarin and Japanese, but I'm not very good at any of them.
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> And can you sing a song in French?
                            <br><br> <b>Alice</b>
                            <br> How about Frere Jacque? (Sings) Come on Amith - your turn.
                            <br><br> <b>Amith</b>
                            <br> OK, a song in Hindi (Sings).
                            <br><br> <b>Sophie</b>
                            <br> That was lovely Amith! I think that's all we've got time for with questions. I think we know each other a little better now.

                        Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        And me, Sophie. Hello. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Today’s programme is all about questions. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes: we’ll take a look at different types of yes-no questions… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        We’ll hear lots of w-h questions… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And we’ll be using the questions to get to know each other a little bit better.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        So if you want a reminder of English question forms… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Or if you’re if you’re studying them for the first time… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Keep listening and join in with the task we’ll be giving you later on. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        So let’s get started. 
                        In English, there are two basic question types: <b>yes/no questions</b> and <b>w-h questions.</b> <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And here’s Finn with our first yes-no question: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Can you speak English? Can you speak English? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Thanks Finn. That’s a useful first question. <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, and it’s made with the auxiliary verb <b>can</b>, plus the subject you</b> and a verb: speak.</b> Can you 
                        speak? Can you speak English Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Yes, I can. Another question please Finn? <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Do you work every day? Do you work every day? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb <b>work.</b> Do you work every day, Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I don't, no. I don't work at weekends. Finn? <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        Do you have any brothers and sisters? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Auxiliary <b>do</b>, subject <b>you</b>, verb: <b>have</b>. Neil, do you have any brothers or sisters? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Yes I do I've got one sister. Now another way to make yes-no questions is with the verb <b>to be</b> plus a subject. Let’s demonstrate. Sophie: Are you married? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        No, Neil, I’m not. Is your boss married? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        My boss? No, he isn't. Were you in the office yesterday? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, sadly I was in the office yesterday. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And we're talking about question forms.  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now the second main type of question in English starts with either <b>what</b>, <b>where</b>, <b>when</b>, <b>which</b>, 
                        <b>why</b>, <b>who</b>, or the odd one out: <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        … <b>how.</b> <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        So let’s try making a question with <b>where.</b> We add an auxiliary… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        … such as <b>do</b> <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        … then we can add a subject plus a verb. For example: Neil: Where do you live? Where do you 
                        live? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I live in south London. Where do you live Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        I live in north London. Now let’s change the question word and the verb. Which languages 
                        do you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And here we add a noun to <b>which:</b> Which languages do you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Just English. And with a different auxiliary: Which languages can you speak?  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        We can add nouns to some of the other question words: What time do you start work? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        About 9 o'clock in the morning. And if we ask What time is it? We’re making a <b>w-h</b> question 
                        with the verb <b>to be.</b> I can ask: Where were you born? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        I was born in England. When is your birthday? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        In September. What is your work address? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        It's W1A. Lots of useful questions with <b>to be</b> there. Now for a very personal question with 
                        <b>to be</b>: Sophie: How old are you? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        You should never ask a woman her age! And for questions with <b>how</b>, we usually add an 
                        extra word. To ask about age it’s: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How old… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        For price it’s: <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How much… <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        For size we ask: <br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How big… <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And for height it’s  <br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        How tall.  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        How tall are you, Neil? <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        About 180cm. And of course, you can’t answer a <b>w-h</b> question with <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> How tall are 
                        you, Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        I think we're actually the same height.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Let me see, back to back… No, I'm taller! 
                        Is it time for a practice task Sophie? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Yes, it is. Join in at home if you like. I’m going to give you a topic to ask me about, and you 
                        have to make one <b>yes/no</b> question and one <b>w-h</b> question. And Neil will give some possible 
                        answers. Here’s the first topic: Ask me about my age. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b>: <br>
                        Ok so you could ask: How old are you? When were you born? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now ask me about my home. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Do you live with your family? What is your address? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Now ask me about my work. <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        Do you work near here? How much do you earn? <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        Thanks Neil. And well done to you at home if you joined in with the task.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        So that’s a look at some basic question types we can use when we’re getting to know 
                        people. We had <b>yes/no</b> questions...  <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b> <br>
                        And we looked at questions starting with <b>w-h</b> words.  <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>
                        And we found out some interesting information about each other. I didn’t know how tall 
                        you were, Sophie?! <br>
                        <b>Neil</b> <br>

                                This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who loved money and didn't like Christmas. There he was, on Christmas Eve, in his office. He was keeping an eye on his clerk Bob Cratchit. Scrooge wanted to get every little bit of work from Cratchit before allowing him to spend Christmas Day at home. Scrooge thought Christmas was a waste of time! Even his nephew couldn't convince him that it wasn't. <br><br>
                                <b>IN SCROOGE'S OFFICE</b><br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
                                A Merry Christmas, uncle!<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge</b><br>
                                Bah! Humbug!<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
                                You don't mean that, I'm sure!<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge</b><br>
                                What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money? You find yourself a year older, but not an hour richer! What good has it ever done you?<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br>
                                I've always thought of Christmas as a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time. A time when men and women seem to open their hearts freely. It's never put money in my pocket, but I believe that it's done me good!<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge</b><br>
                                Humbug!<br><br>

                                Scrooge's nephew was persistent but the old man wouldn't change his mind. He was in his usual bad mood when two gentlemen came to his office to ask for a donation to offer Christmas dinner to the poor. Scrooge worked in the money-lending business. No donation from him...<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge</b><br>
                                Gentlemen, are there no prisons and workhouses, where the poor receive food and accommodation in return for some work?<br><br>
                                <b>Gentleman</b><br>
                                We wish we could say there aren't any, Mr Scrooge. Many poor people would rather die than go to prison or the...<br><br>
                                <b>Scrooge</b><br>
                                They should die and decrease the surplus population. And... well, it's none of my business anyway. They cost a lot of money, and the poor should go there. Goodbye, sir.<br><br>
                                <b>Narrator</b><br>
                                Typical Scrooge! He feels sorry for no-one, helps no-one. With him, it's all about money. He thought of nothing else. His partner, Jacob Marley, had died seven years before, at Christmas. Marley was like Scrooge when he was alive. But now he was gone. Or was he?<br><br>
                                <b>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE </b><br><br>

                                Marley, is it really you?! And what is this strange metal chain you are wearing? It's made of cash-boxes, keys, locks, heavy purses...<br><br>
                                <b>Marley</b><br>
                                I wear the chain I made in life. Of my own free will I wore it when I was alive. Is its pattern strange to you? Or do you wish to know the weight and length of the heavy chain you are carrying yourself? <br><br>

                                Don't say that, Jacob. And why is this happening to you? You were always a good man of business…<br><br>
                                <b>Marley</b><br>
                                Business!? Mankind was my business. Charity, kindness - were all my business. Why did I walk through crowds of people with my eyes turned down? I'm here to warn you, that you still have a chance of escaping my fate. You'll be visited by three spirits. Expect the first spirit tomorrow at one o'clock in the morning. And remember what I've told you.<br><br>

                                Marley disappeared into the night, flying out of an open window with other ghosts which looked as miserable as him. Scrooge was shocked. I'll tell you about the visit of the first spirit next time<br>

                        Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn...<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        And I’m Alice. Today we’re looking at a very important part of word building – suffixes.<br><br>

                        Suffixes. We’ll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        There’ll be a quiz…<br><br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        And we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        So: to start off, we’re going to listen to Andrea and Steve who work in a bank. They have just interviewed two people who want to work there.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        And here’s a question to think about while you listen: who did Andrea and Steve like best - the first person or the second person?<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Who did they like best? Let’s find out.<br><br> 
                        <b>INSERT</b><br><br> 
                        <b>Andrea</b> <br>
                        What do you think then Steve?<br><br> 
                        <b>Steve</b> <br>
                        Well, the first one was very excitable: he kept laughing and speaking fast.<br><br>
                        <b>Andrea</b> <br>
                        Perhaps it was just nervousness, but there’s no room for that in this business.<br><br>
                        <b>Steve</b> <br>
                        No. Now I thought the second interviewee seemed a bit more responsible.<br><br>
                        <b>Andrea</b> <br>
                        Yes, she did – very important when dealing with money. And she was polite.<br><br>
                        <b>Steve</b> <br>
                        Politeness is essential in this job.<br><br>
                        <b>Andrea</b> <br>
                        Absolutely. Well, I think we both know which one is more employable.<br><br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        So, that’s Steve and Andrea. And we asked you: who did they like best?<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        And the answer is: they definitely liked the second person best. The second one was polite and responsible. The first one was a bit too excitable.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        That’s right, and excitable is a key word in the show today because it ends in a suffix.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Now in the world of vocabulary, a suffix is a group of letters that you can add to the end of a word to change its form, or meaning, or both.<br><br>  
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        For example, the word excitable has the suffix -able, spelt a-b-l-e. -able makes verbs into adjectives, and we use –able words to say that a subject can do something – is able to do something - or they behave in a particular way.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        So if we take the verb excite, add the suffix -able, we can say that the first interviewee was excitable, meaning: he can get very excited.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        And the second one was responsible, that’s responsible with –ible, spelt ‘i-b-l-e’. She can be trusted to do the right thing. And that’s why she was more employable, now that's -able with an a again.<br>
                        Now for another suffix. Andrea and Steve talked about two interviewees. The suffix –ee, spelt e-e, makes a noun which means ‘the person who receives an action’.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        For example, if you add –ee to interview, you get the person who receives an interview, an interviewee.<br><br>
                        <b>IDENT</b> <br>
                        You’re listening to BBC Learning English dot com.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        And we’re talking about suffixes. Our final suffix for today is –ness, spelt n-e-s-s. Adding –ness to an adjective makes a noun.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        That’s right, and interviewee number one suffered from nervousness – the noun form of nervous.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        But number two understood the importance of politeness – the noun form of polite. Is politeness important to you Alice?<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Oh yes Finn, politeness is very important to me.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        I think you’re very polite. Now let’s listen to today’s suffixes and words again.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        The first one was: -able with an a. a-b-l-e.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        excitable, employable<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        -ible withan i. i-b-l-e.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        responsible<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        -ee: e-e<br><br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        interviewee<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        -ness: n-e-s-s<br><br> 
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        nervousness, politeness<br><br> 
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        And it’s time for a quiz. Choose the correct suffix to complete the final words in these 2 sentences. Ready?<br>
                        Number 1.The most important thing to me is my family’s… <br>a) happy-ee <br>b) happy-able, <br>c) happiness.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        This one is the noun form of happy, so it’s c) happiness.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Number 2. I’m learning how to do this job. I’m a <br>a) trainee <br>b) trainable, <br>c) train-ness.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        You are receiving training, so you’re a trainee.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Well done if you got those right.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b> <br>
                        And that brings us almost to the end of today’s programme.<br><br>

                                Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish man who didn't like Christmas. Last time, the ghost of his dead partner, Marley, told Scrooge he would be visited by three spirits. They would give him a chance of escaping Marley's fate. Scrooge was in bed when the curtains were opened and he saw a face...

                                The Spirit took Scrooge through a wall and suddenly they found themselves on an open country road. The city had disappeared. Scrooge was very excited.

                                Mr Fezziwig had the power to make us happy or unhappy; to make our work easy or hard; pleasure or pain.

Then, the young Scrooge was starting to look obsessed with money. He wasn't alone. There was a young woman by his side. Oh, she was crying...

                                It was hard for Scrooge to see how his girlfriend left him when he started to fall in love with money. But the Spirit's work wasn't done yet. He took Scrooge to yet another Christmas a few years from then. And the greedy, old man saw her happy with a husband and children - children who he almost wished were his own. Scrooge was very depressed when he got back home: the kind sister whose son he rejected, the generous employer, the lost girlfriend – that's a lot to take in! But there were still two spirits left. What would the Spirit of Christmas Present show Scrooge? Let's see it tomorrow. I can't wait!

                        I like some elements of my job very much. When you're on holiday you tend to only see certain parts of the country that are pretty. But being a travel journalist, you get to see other parts of the country you wouldn't normally get to visit.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                       
                        What's the most interesting place you have ever visited?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        I'd say the most interesting place I have ever visited was Angola. It's somewhere I wouldn't normally go, but I found being there very exciting.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                        
                        What's a normal day for you at work?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        There is no normal day for me at work. Some days I might be scripting or editing or filming on location. Every day tends to be slightly different.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                        
                        Do you meet interesting people?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        I meet some very interesting people. For example, only a month ago I was in South Africa at a town where they'd had problems with baboons inside people's homes. There was one man whose job it was to chase these baboons out of town. And to do this, he'd managed to perfectly imitate a baboon call. It worked very well.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                        
                        Do you ever feel scared?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        I very rarely feel scared on location as we're very busy. We're too busy to feel scared. However, there have been some instances when we've been, for example, in the mountains with people we don't know very well who've had a lot to drink and we've had to leave in a hurry.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                        
                        Can you relax when you're working?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        I can very rarely relax when I'm working. When other people who have gone on holiday or who are less busy on a film shoot can relax in the evening, they can have a glass of wine and maybe a nice, long meal. I have to go back to the hotel room and make sure everything's ok for the next day and to deal with all the pictures and video we've shot during that previous day.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                        
                        Is there anything bad about your job?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        While being on the road can be exciting and exhilarating, I am a new dad and I have a very young baby daughter at home. Not only do I miss her while I'm away a week maybe two weeks at a time but I also feel very guilty that my partner has to take full responsibility for her.<br><br>                        
                        <b>Question</b><br><br>                        
                        Do you have a dream job?<br><br>                        
                        <b>Keith</b><br><br>                        
                        Being a travel journalist isn't like being on holiday. It is a lot of hard work and sometimes we can be working for 14 or 15 hours at a time. However, you will get the odd occasion where you're somewhere very nice, somewhere by a beach or in the mountains with a nice view and you're waiting for a cameraman or interviewee to turn up and you can then have a look around and take in your surroundings and at that time it does feel like you have a dream job, yes.

                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Ebenezer Scrooge woke up just before the clock struck one again. He was ready for the Spirit of Christmas Present. This time, he met his guide in the next room, which looked very different from usual. It was decorated with holly and other plants. On the table, there was a lot of delicious Christmas food like turkey, cake, fruit... Scrooge talked to the ghost.<br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Spirit, take me where you like. Last night I learnt a lesson. Tonight, if you want to teach me, let me profit by it.<br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Oh, that's not the Scrooge we knew before. No longer arrogant?! Well, the Spirit took Scrooge to the edge of the city where his clerk Bob Cratchit lived. The man entered his humble home carrying a little boy who had a crutch and iron around his legs. His wife was preparing the meal.<br>
                            <b>AT BOB CRATCHIT'S HOUSE</b><br><br>
                            <b>Mrs Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            How did Tiny Tim behave at church, Robert?<br>
                            <b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            As good as gold! He told me on our way home that he hoped that people noticed him in the church, because he's disabled. It might be good for them to remember on Christmas Day our Lord, who made lame people walk and blind men see.<br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Tiny Tim was a sweet little boy who knew the meaning of Christmas. But he was very sick. Scrooge felt sorry for him and asked the Spirit what was going to happen.<br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.<br>
                            <b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
                            I see an empty seat in the corner, and a crutch without an owner. If things don't change in the future, the child will die.<br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            No, no. Oh, no, kind Spirit. Say he'll live!<br>
                            <b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
                            If he's going to die, he should do it, and decrease the surplus population.<br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            These words caused a huge and sudden feeling of deep regret in Scrooge's heart. That was exactly what he had said earlier to the gentlemen who had asked for a donation to help the poor. If the poor died it would be good to help decrease the surplus population. Then, Scrooge heard Cratchit mention his name...<br>
                            <b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            After this wonderful dinner, let's raise our glasses. A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears! God bless us! And also Mr Scrooge, the Father of the Feast! Come on, dear wife!<br>
                            <b>Mrs Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            I wish I had him here, Robert. I'd give him a piece of my mind! Such a horrible, hard, unfeeling man, Mr Scrooge. I'll drink to his health because it is Christmas, but not because of him.<br>
                            <b>Tiny Tim</b><br><br>
                            God bless us every one!<br>
                            <b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            Thank you, Tim, my dear child.<br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            There was no doubt Scrooge was the monster of the family. But if the thought of her husband's selfish boss annoyed Mrs Cratchit, it caused laughter elsewhere. The Ghost of Christmas Present took Scrooge to his nephew's house - to the Christmas dinner the old man had refused to go to.<br>
                            <b>AT SCROOGE'S NEPHEW'S HOUSE </b><br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge's Nephew</b><br><br>
                            ...and my uncle said that Christmas was a humbug! He's a funny man, that's the truth. And not as pleasant as he could be. However, his crimes carry their own price. His money is of no use to him. He doesn't do any good with it. He doesn't make himself comfortable with it.<br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            The house was full of people dancing, playing games. The Spirit noticed that Scrooge was enjoying himself. The night was coming to an end when Scrooge saw two figures at the ghost's feet. What were they? They looked like children, but they were old and frightening. Scrooge was shocked.<br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            I'm sorry to ask but... are they yours? <br>
                            <b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
                            They are Man's creatures. The boy is Ignorance. The girl is Want. Be afraid of them both, but most of all you should fear this boy for on his face I see a terrible destiny!<br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Don't they have a place to go?<br>
                            <b>Spirit of Christmas Present</b><br><br>
                            Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?<br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Yes, once more Scrooge had his own words repeated back to him. He had always thought the poor had prisons and workhouses to go to, hadn't he? Eat your words, Mr Scrooge! Well, the bell struck twelve and that was it for the Ghost of Christmas Present. He disappeared. But the third spirit was coming. You'll hear about it next time.<br>

                        I usually wear a skirt, a shirt and a scarf but today, I chose jeans and a jumper. Hmm... but then I thought I look too scruffy, so I'm wearing this dress instead.<br><br>

                            Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come couldn't have been more different from the Spirit of Christmas Present Scrooge had just seen disappearing. It was very tall and it was hidden in a black cape and hood. It didn't speak at all. Scrooge was getting used to the company of ghosts by now but he was afraid of this one.<br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Ghost of the Future, I am more afraid of you than any spirit I've seen. But I know your purpose is to do me good. And I hope to become another man from the one I was, so I am prepared to be in your company. And do it with a thankful heart.<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Was Scrooge really changing his ways? They went to the financial district and the Spirit stopped near a group of businessmen who were chatting.<br><br>
                            <b>Businessman 1</b><br><br>
                            I don't know much about it. I only know he's dead. It's likely to be a very cheap funeral! I'm certain I don't know of anybody who'll go to it. Should we volunteer?<br><br>
                            <b>Businessman 2</b><br><br>
                            I don't mind going if a lunch is provided! What happened to the money?<br><br>
                            <b>Businessman 1</b><br><br>
                            Well, he didn't give it to me!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Scrooge knew these men. But why did the Spirit make him listen to this conversation? No answer. Then the Spirit took him to a bad part of town. Criminals lived there. Some people were trying to sell stolen goods and they were making fun of the person who used to own them.<br><br>
                            <b>Housekeeper</b><br><br>
                            Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose. He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive, but he profits us now he's dead!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And even the shirt the dead man was wearing was sold. A Housekeeper, a laundress, an undertaker - they stood in line to make a profit on the dead man's things. Scrooge was shocked! He asked the Ghost to show him people with kindness towards the dead. And where do you think they went? Scrooge found himself back at Bob Cratchit's house. But this time everybody was sad and quiet. Bob Cratchit had just returned from church where he had made arrangements for somebody's funeral.<br><br>
                            <b>Mrs Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            How was it, Robert?<br><br>
                            <b>Bob Cratchit</b><br><br>
                            I wish you could have been there, dear wife. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child...<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Scrooge knew now that Tiny Tim was dead. But who was that man whose death others were talking about? The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come took Scrooge to a graveyard and pointed ahead. On the stone of a neglected grave, the old man read a name: Ebenezer Scrooge! It was his own name! It was Scrooge's grave!<br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            No, Spirit. Oh no, no! Spirit, hear me. I'm not the man I was. Why show me this, if all hope is gone?<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Wow! That's a brand new Scrooge we're seeing! And he's not done yet in his pleading...<br><br>
                            <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>
                            Good Spirit, tell me that I still may change these shadows you have shown me, by changing my life. I will celebrate Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I'll live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall live within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me that I may remove the writing on this stone!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Scrooge grabbed the Spirit's hand. The Spirit tried to free itself. In the end, it just disappeared. Scrooge found himself grabbing his own bedpost. What will happen now? I'll tell you next time.<br><br>

                        A lot has happened to Ebenezer Scrooge. How will this story end? Scrooge's only love used to be money, but now he might be a changed man! After the struggle with the frightening Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come, he found himself in his own bed, in his own room, and he felt happy and ready to change his life.<br><br>

                        I'm as light as a bird, I'm as happy as an angel, I'm as merry as a schoolboy, I'm as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hello!<br><br>                        
                        <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                        Scrooge ran to the window and put out his head. Bells are ringing! Ah! The sun was shining, the air felt fresh. Everything was wonderful!<br><br>                        
                        <b>Scrooge</b><br><br>

                        It's Christmas Day. I haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. Hello, my good boy. Do you know whether they've sold the special turkey that was hanging up there?<br><br>

                        Yes! Go and buy it, and tell them to bring it here, so I may give them the address to take it to. Come back with the man, and I'll give you a little money. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you a lot of money.<br><br>

                        Then Scrooge went to the streets. He was greeting everyone: "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" He approached the gentlemen who had asked him to help the poor. He had behaved so badly before, when he refused to give anything. But now, he offered them a generous donation.<br><br>

                        In the afternoon Scrooge went to his nephew's house for that dinner he was invited to but didn't want to go to. Do you remember that? How will his nephew react?<br><br>

                        His nephew received him with open arms. And what a party it was! It was great to be in that same party the Spirit of Christmas Present had shown him before. And this time everybody could see Scrooge and talk to him. The next morning, the old man went to the office very early to catch Bob Cratchit coming late. Eighteen and a half minutes late!<br><br>

                        Scrooge did it all, and much, much more. He became a second father to Tiny Tim, who did not die, and a good friend to all. Some people laughed to see how he'd changed, but he let them laugh. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. It was always said of Scrooge, that he knew how to keep the Christmas cheer alive and well. I hope we do the same. Tiny Tim has the last word:<br><br>

                        While you listen, try to answer this question. What does Mike wear to the party?<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        Let's find out.<br><br>
                        <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                        You're not seriously going to the party dressed like that! You'll be the most scruffily-dressed man there.<br><br>
                        <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                        The invitation said casual, so I'm dressing casually: jeans and a T-shirt. What's wrong with that?<br><br>   
                        <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                        It's too scruffy: the invitation said smart-casual. You need to wear something much smarter, Mike.<br><br>   
                        <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                        What, a suit?<br><br>   
                        <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                        No, that's too formal - it's not a job interview. Just wear a nice fashionable shirt.<br><br>   
                        <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                        But I hate fashion. I can't dress fashionably. I'm the most unfashionable person I know.<br><br>
                        <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                        Well, you'll be the only one in a T-shirt.<br><br>
                        <b>Mike</b><br><br>
                        OK, you win. I'll wear my black shirt and the smart shoes. But I'm still wearing my jeans.<br><br>
                        <b>Sarah</b><br><br>
                        If you must.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        So, did you hear what Mike wore to the party in the end?<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        He wore a black shirt, jeans, and his smart shoes.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        Well done if you got that right. Now, let's take a closer look at some of the fashion-related vocabulary we heard there - starting with some of the adjectives.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        Yes and of course adjectives are words which describe nouns, and there were lots of adjectives describing people and their clothes. Sarah thinks Mike is scruffy.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        Which means not neat or clean.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        But Mike wants to be casual.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        Informal and comfortable.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        She thinks he should be smart.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        Nice and stylish.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        But not too formal.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        Old-fashioned and serious.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        And she wants him to wear something fashionable.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        New and stylish.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        Now, we can change these words into adverbs - words that describe verbs. And Mike and Sarah used lots of adverbs to describe the way people dress. We heard: scruffily, casually, smartly, formally and fashionably.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        And because they are adverbs, they all end in the letters 'l-y'. Here are some clips from the conversation. Listen out for adverbs which describe the verb dress.<br><br>
                        You'll be the most scruffily-dressed man there.<br><br>
                        So I'm dressing casually. Jeans and a T-shirt.<br><br>            
                        I can't dress fashionably.<br><br>                            
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        And coming up soon is our vocabulary quiz: but first, let's have a quick recap of today's fashion-related vocabulary.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        First we had some adjectives.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        Scruffy, casual, smart, formal, fashionable.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        And then we looked at some adverbs.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        Scruffily, casually, smartly, formally, fashionably.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        And now: it's quiz time. All you have to do is finish the sentences with words from today's programme. There are two sentences, each with three choices. So, are we ready? Number 1: Everyone is wearing tight jeans this year - they are really: a) fashion b) fashionable c) fashionably.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        The answer is: b) fashionable.<br><br>                            
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        That's right. Now, question 2. I had a job interview yesterday, so I dressed very: a) formally b) scruffy c) formal.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        It's: a) formally.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        That's right.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        I hope you got that at home. And that brings us to the end of today's show, so we'll leave you with today's top tip for learning vocabulary, which is, Finn...<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        To help you remember how to use adjectives and adverbs, it's a really good idea to write down example sentences.<br><br>
                        <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                        That's right. Example sentences will help you use words more accurately than if you just note down the word with a translation.<br><br>

                    <p>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Hello. This is the story of an ordinary girl called Alice. Our story begins on an ordinary summer's day. Let's meet Alice: here she is, sitting next to the river with her sister on a very hot summer's afternoon. Her sister is reading a book, and with no-one to talk to, Alice is bored… and a bit sleepy. Soon, she'll be in a Wonderland full of strange and wonderful adventures… but Alice doesn't know that yet…<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ohh… There's nothing to do… except lie on the grass and pick daisies. Shall I make a daisy chain for my dear little Dinah? Oh… I don't know… it's sooo hot…  <br><br>
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm late! I'm so very late! Oh dear oh dear!<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            A white rabbit! A talking white rabbit? Perhaps. But a rabbit with a pocket-watch? A rabbit with pockets? I must see where he's going!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice had never seen a rabbit with a pocket, or a waistcoat, or a pocket-watch before. So, she ran after the rabbit as fast as she could, and when the rabbit jumped down a large rabbit hole, Alice jumped straight after him.<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oohhhh… Either this hole is very deep or I'm falling very slowly. And what a curious rabbit-hole! Who would think a rabbit-hole would have bookshelves… and books … and maps … and jars of marmalade?<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice fell down, down, down. She fell for so long that she began to think about Dinah, her cat.<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Dinah will miss me tonight!I hope they'll remember her milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice was beginning to feel quite sleepy when suddenly, her fall was over and she found herself sitting on a pile of leaves and grass. <br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ouch! Who's there?<br><br>
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh, my ears and whiskers! How late it's getting!!<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Wait! Please sir, wait a moment!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            The White Rabbit ran down a long tunnel. Alice ran after him. But when she reached the end of the tunnel she found only a long hall with doors all the way round. Alice tried to open the doors – but they were all locked. Then she saw a table with a tiny key on it.<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            These doors are all too big. There must be a smaller door somewhere. I wonder… hmmm, let me look behind this little curtain… ooh! a tiny little door! Let me try the key... What a beautiful garden! But how can I visit it? The door is so tiny – I can't even fit my head through! Oh! It's no use. I wish I could fold up like a telescope! Wait a minute… what's this? It certainly wasn't here before. A bottle – I wonder what it is. Let me see the label. Hmmm: Drink me… Oh! Oh! Ohhhhhh!!!! What a curious feeling! I'm folding up like a telescope!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And so she was! Alice got smaller and smaller until she was small enough to fit through the door. But she'd forgotten something …<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            The key!<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice was too small to reach the key on the table. She tried and tried to climb up the table leg but it was too slippery. When she had tired herself out with trying, poor little Alice sat down and cried.<br><br>
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            It's no use. I can't reach the key, so I can't get into the garden and that's that. There's no use crying like that! (sharply) Alice! I advise you to stop this minute! … Oohh… what's this? A little glass box… with cake inside! Ooh: and there's a note. Eat me. Hmmm. I wonder if it will make me grow... if I grow, I will be able to reach the key. But what if makes me even smaller? Well, if it makes me smaller, I will be able to creep under the door.<br><br>
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And Alice began to eat the cake. Did she grow big enough to reach the key? Or perhaps the cake made her small enough to creep under the door and into her beautiful garden. I'll tell you what happened next time. Goodbye.

                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Sophie.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And me, Neil. Hello.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Today we’re talking about the present simple tense…<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        ...and the present continuous tense. Coming up in today’s programme:<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        We’ll take a look at positives, negatives, and question forms…<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        We’ll find out when to use each tense…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        We’ll hear some short forms…<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And we’ll have a quiz to test what we’ve learnt.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        But first: the present simple tense. We use it to talk about things that happen regularly. Here’s Finn with an example:<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        John checks his email every morning.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Thanks Finn. So the verb to check is in the present simple – John checks - because he checks his email regularly – every morning.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        We make the present simple with a subject plus a base verb – I check, you go, we live, they wear.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        For he, she and it, add an s to the verb. Can you demonstrate please Finn?<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        I always we­ar a coat in the winter. My brother wears a jacket.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Now we also use the present simple to talk about facts and permanent situations. So we can say…<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        I work in the fashion industry. My sister lives in China.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        To make the present simple negative, use don’t or doesn’t. And there’s no s on the end of the verb. Finn?<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        I don’t work in the modelling industry. My brother doesn’t like fashion.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        For questions, use do or does.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        Do your friends live in London? Does John check his email in the morning?<br><br>
                        <b>STING</b><br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        So that’s present simple. Now: let’s look at the present continuous tense. [SFX: phone rings] Ooh just a minute, let me get that… [to caller] Hello? Sorry, I’m working at the moment. Can I call you back? Sorry about that everyone…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        [bemused] No problem…<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        So: I just said I’m working at the moment.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Aha! A clever demonstration!<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        That’s right – I said I’m working at the moment, because it’s an activity that’s happening now. I can say I work at the BBC in the present simple because my job is a permanent situation. But right now at this moment I’m doing the activity of working, so I use present continuous to say I’m working at the moment.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Right. As well as activities, we use the present continuous tense for temporary situations like this:<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        My parents are staying with me this week. I’m sleeping on the sofa.<br><br>

                        Ok. To make the present continuous, use am, is or are plus an i-n-g verb.<br><br>

                        I’m checking my email at the moment. Emily’s wearing a pink hat today. They’re eating dinner now.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And did you hear those short forms? The words I am are shortened to I’m…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Emily is sounds like Emily’s.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And they are sounds like they’re. We’ll have short forms in just a moment.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And today we’re talking about the present simple tense…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        … and the present continuous.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Let’s look at present continuous negatives. We make them with the little word <b>not</b>.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        I’m not wearing a raincoat because it isn’t raining.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        And here are those short forms again:<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        I am not becomes…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        … I’m not.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Is not…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        … isn’t<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And for are not we get…<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        … aren’t.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        I’m not wearing shoes. He isn’t working today. You aren’t watching television.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Umm Neil, are you sending an email?<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Errr - yes… [slightly bewildered] What are we doing? Are we talking about questions?<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Yes, we are.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Ooh, sorry – Back to the programme!<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Aha! Another clever demonstration! I said: Are you sending an email?<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And I said: Are we talking about questions?<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        And of course, we both asked present continuous yes/no questions.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And to make them, you just change the word order. Instead of You are sending an email, it’s Are you sending an email?<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        And change We are talking about questions to Are we talking about questions?<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        It’s fine to put question words like why or what at the start of the question.<br><br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br><br>
                        What are we doing? Why are you sending an email?<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        So that’s present continuous questions.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        So that means: it’s time for a quiz. Join in if you like. I’m going to say a sentence and you need to make it negative. Neil will give the answer. Ready? Number 1. Paolo speaks Chinese.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Paolo doesn’t speak Chinese.<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        Now make this sentence into a yes/no question: The children are playing a game.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Are the children playing a game?<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        And one more: this time, make a present continuous question starting with why. Simon is learning Japanese.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        Why is Simon learning Japanese?<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br><br>
                        And that’s the end of the quiz – well done if you got them all right.<br><br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br><br>
                        And that’s also the end of the programme – but there’s more about these tenses on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.<br><br>

                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Hello! Alice is having some very curious adventures at the bottom of a rabbit hole. She drank a drink that made her very small indeed. But she wants to grow bigger so that she can reach the key that will unlock the tiny door to a beautiful garden. After eating some cake she found in a little glass box, Alice started to feel something…<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Curiouser and curiouser! I'm growing! My feet are so far away. Goodbye feet! How will I put my shoes and socks on, I wonder? Ouch!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice grew so big that her head hit the ceiling! It was easy to reach the table now. She picked up the tiny key and rushed to the door. But in her excitement, she forgot something again…<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ohhhh… this is hopeless! I'm much too big for this door now! I'll never get into the garden! I can only look through the door with one eye! Oh…<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice was over nine feet tall, and when a girl that big cries, the tears are big too. Alice cried and cried until half the hall was filledwith a salty pool of tears. After a time, Alice heard a little pattering of feet in the distance. She dried her eyes to see what was coming.<br><br>                            
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh! I'm late! I'm so very late! I was told to be early and I'm going to be late. The Duchess will be waiting. Oh my! Oh my! She will be so very angry with me! Oh my!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            The sight of The White Rabbit, splendidly dressed in his best clothes, and carrying a large fan and a pair of white leather gloves was enough to stop Alice's tears.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            If you please, sir…<br><br>                            
                            <b>White Rabbit</b><br><br>
                            Oh!! Oh my!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Don't go! I won't hurt – Oh dear! You've dropped your gloves… But look: what a pretty fan. And crying is such hot work. Oh, that's better. Oh dear… how strange everything is today. Yesterday things were normal. But today I'm not sure if I am the same girl who woke up this morning. But, if I'm not the girl who woke up this morning, the question is, "Who am I?"<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Alice fanned herself while she talked. She felt much cooler. But after a minute or two, something started happening.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oh: Here's that feeling again.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Then something kept happening. Alice kept fanning herself.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            I don't believe it. I must be… I am! I'm growing smaller again. Smaller than the table. Hello feet! It's good to see you again.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Soon Alice was smaller than ever. She was still shrinking and shrinking and she didn't know why.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oh dear - I'm getting very small. Oh… I'm getting much too small! Oh dear - I shall fade away altogether! Ohh…! The fan? The fan!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Just in time. Alice threw the fan on the floor, so she wouldn't get any smaller.  <br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            That was a lucky escape! But now I'm small enough to get into the garden!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Poor Alice! There she stood at the little door - but it was locked again. And there was the little key, back in its place, out of reach, on the table.<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Oh not again! This is hopeless. I'll never get that key now. I so badly wanted to see the garden. And things are worse than ever - I've never been so small as this in my life. Never!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            Things were as bad as ever. And they were about to get worse...<br><br>                            
                            <b>Alice</b><br><br>
                            Ohhh!<br><br>                            
                            <b>Narrator</b><br><br>
                            And poor little Alice fell into a pool of her own tears. Luckily, she knew how to swim. But she wasn't the only one who had fallen into the pool. Next time, Alice meets a dodo, tries to make friends with a mouse, and joins in a very, very curious race. Goodbye.

                        Hello. So far, Alice had been very small, then very tall, then very small again in this strange Wonderland she found when she chased a talking rabbit and fell down the rabbit hole. Now she was swimming in a pool of her own tears, wondering what was going to happen next.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Ooh, whatever's this? It's a mouse! Hello mouse! You're a very big mouse… but then, I'm a very, very little girl today. Whatever next? If this mouse talks, I won't be at all surprised… Oh Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I'm very tired of swimming about here, Mouse! Mouse? Hmmm. Perhaps it doesn't understand English. Maybe it's a French mouse! Now, what was that French I learned in school? <i>Où est ma chatte?</i>
                        <br><br> <b>Mouse</b> <br>
                        Chatte? Cat! Did you say cat?!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Oh, I'm so sorry Mouse! I forgot mice don't like cats
                        <br><br> <b>Mouse</b> <br>
                        Would you like cats if you were me?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Well… perhaps not. But my cat Dinah is different. She's such a sweet, quiet thing. If you meet her, I'm sure you'll like her.
                        <br><br> <b>Mouse</b> <br>
                        We won't talk about cats any more, thank you!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b> <br>
                        We won't! Er… do you - do you er… like dogs? They can be so sweet and they kill all the rats… and… Oh dear!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Oh please come back, dear Mouse. We won't talk about cats or dogs, if you don't like them. Swim with me to the shore.
                        <br><br> <b>Narrator</b><br>
                        So Alice and the mouse swam to the edge of the pool of tears. And as they swam, they were joined by lots of other creatures that had fallen into the pool, just like Alice and the mouse. There was a duck and a dodo and many other strange animals that Alice had never seen before. All the creatures had the same question.
                        <br><br> <b>Animals</b> <br>
                        How can we get dry? What can we do? I'm so far away from my nest, that pool was very wet and salty, oh it's no good for my fur, etc…
                        <br><br> <b>Dodo</b> <br>
                        We must have a Caucus-race!
                        <br><br> <b>Animals</b> <br>
                        Hooray! Hoorah!
                        <br><br> <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        What's a Caucus-race, Mr Dodo?
                        <br><br> <b>Dodo</b> <br>
                        The best way to explain a Caucus-race is to have a Caucus-race!
                        <br><br> <b>Narrator</b><br>
                        It was the strangest race Alice had ever seen. The Dodo marked a circle for the racecourse and everyone stood anywhere they wanted to. Nobody said "One, two, three, go!" but everyone started running. Alice ran too, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. Everyone ran left and right in any direction they pleased. But after half an hour of running, everybody was quite dry again.
                        <br><br> <b>Dodo</b> <br>
                        The race is over!
                        <br><br> <b>Multiple voices</b> <br>
                        But who has won? Did I win? Who is the winner?
                        <br><br> <b>Dodo</b> <br>
                        Ah... yes... Who has won? Who has won? Everybody has won and everyone must have prizes! And she must give the prizes!
                        <br><br> <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Me?
                        <br><br> <b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice didn't have any prizes for a Caucus-race with her, but she searched in her pockets and found some sweets. She had enough sweets to give exactly one sweet to every runner.  
                        <br><br> <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Here you are, one for you, and one for you…
                        <br><br> <b>Animals</b> <br>
                        Thank you very much… oh dear, this has no taste whatsoever… oh, I shall choke…it's rather good, yes very tasty…
                        <br><br> <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        And one for you – now, does everybody have one? Oh, I must say, my cat Dinah would love a Caucus-race…
                        <br><br> <b>Animals</b> <br>
                        Let's go! Come away! Time for bed! Oh, is it that time already? Cats - ugh!
                        <br><br> <b>Alice</b> <br>
                        Oh dear. I said it again. Come back! Please! I'm sorry! Poor Dinah. Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!
                        <br><br> <b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Poor Alice felt very lonely and sad. She cried quietly to herself for a while. But in a little while, she heard footsteps in the distance. She looked up to see who it was. Next time, I'll tell you who the footsteps belonged to, and how Alice got so big she filled a whole house, and what happened when she kicked poor Bill the lizard up and out of the chimney. Goodbye.

                        He likes running in the house and fighting with other cats. He loves catching birds, and sometimes frogs. But he still likes cat food the most.<br>
                        In fact, he's hungry now. He's always hungry. Ok, Ginger, I'm coming!

                        <b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Hello. Alice fell down a Rabbit Hole one day and found herself in a Wonderland, where Animals talk, curious things happen and everything she eats and drinks makes her grow bigger or smaller. Now she is sitting alone. Suddenly, she heard footsteps. The White Rabbit was running towards her. He seemed to be very worried.
                        <br><br><b>White Rabbit</b><br>
                        Oh dear! Where can I have dropped them? I must find them, or I'm sure The Duchess will chop off my head!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>                    
                        Alice guessed he was looking for the gloves and fan that he had dropped - but she didn't know where they were either. After all her growing and shrinking, Alice was exactly the same size as the rabbit. When the White Rabbit saw Alice, he spoke to her quite angrily.
                        <br><br><b>White Rabbit</b><br>
                        Mary Ann! What are you doing out here? Run home this minute and get me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quickly!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        How surprised he'll be when he finds out I'm not Mary Ann!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice began to run, as the White Rabbit had told her, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. But soon, a little house appeared with the words 'W. Rabbit' written on the door.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I won't knock on the door. The real Mary Ann might hear me.
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice crept into the house and went quietly upstairs to a little bedroom… and there she found two fans, three pairs of gloves and…
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Another bottle! I hope it makes me grow bigger again. I'm tired of being such a tiny little thing!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        …and sure enough, Alice began to grow. Taller and taller she grew, until…
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Ouch! My head! That's quite tall enough. That's tall enough! O-o-o-oh…
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice tried her hardest to stop growing - but it seemed to her like the harder she tried, the taller she grew. Soon Alice was so big that she filled the whole room. Her head pressed against the ceiling, her arm went out of the window and one of her feet went up the chimney.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        What will become of me now?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Outside the house, a crowd started to gather. Alice heard voices.
                        <br><br><b>Voices</b><br>
                        Oh my goodness, oh my - whatever could it be? What is it?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Soon, the White Rabbit arrived.
                        <br><br><b>White Rabbit</b><br>
                        What's that in the window?
                        <br><br><b>Voice</b><br>
                        It's an arm, sir!
                        <br><br><b>White Rabbit</b><br>
                        An arm? Well, it's got no business being there! Bill! Bill! Fetch the ladder and take it away!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Bill was the gardener. He brought a ladder and climbed up on to the roof.
                        <br><br><b>White Rabbit</b><br>
                        I won't have an arm in my bedroom! Down you go Bill, down the chimney!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Poor Bill went up the ladder and tried to go down the chimney. But Alice's foot was waiting for him… with a big kick.
                        <br><br><b>Bill</b><br>
                        Ohhhhhhhh!!!!
                        <br><br><b>Voices</b><br>
                        Oohs and ahhs, gasps etc Is he hurt? Help him up, give him some air…
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        There! That's got rid of him! Now what will they try?
                        <br><br><b>Voices</b><br>
                        Try the cakes!
                        <br><br><b>White Rabbit</b><br>
                        Yes! The cakes: bring the cakes! We'll need a lot of them. That's right. Now, everybody, throw them through the other window!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        What's this…? Oh! Lots and lots of little cakes.  I wonder… If I ate them, would I shrink again? They must do something… and I must get out of this house. I'll try just one of them to start with.
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice ate one of the little cakes, and soon found herself to be a little smaller. She ate another and another, until at last she was just the right size to run out of the bedroom… and out of the house.
                        <br><br><b>Voices</b><br>
                        There she is! What is it? Get her! Catch her, quickly!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        But Alice was too fast for them. She ran far away from the White Rabbit's house, deeper and deeper into the forest until she became quite lost. She was wondering what she could eat or drink to make her grow to the right size again, when suddenly she saw in front of her a large mushroom - about the same size as herself, with a large blue caterpillar sitting on top of it, smoking a pipe and taking no notice of Alice at all. Will the caterpillar help Alice to grow again? I'll tell you next time.

                        After Alice frightened everyone by growing as big as a house, she ate some little cakes and shrank again. She doesn't like being so tiny, so she's looking for something to make her grow to the right size. But this is Wonderland and what she finds, sitting on top of a mushroom, is very curious indeed…
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Am I as small as a mushroom, or is the mushroom as tall as me? Ohh!!

                        <br>
                        <br><b>Caterpillar</b><br>
                        What size do you want to be?
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Oh, I don't mind. A little bit bigger is all I would like. Seven centimetres is such a terrible height!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Caterpillar</b><br>
                        It is a very good height! I myself am exactly seven centimetres in height!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        And with that, the caterpillar crawled off the mushroom and away.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Caterpillar</b><br>
                        One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter. Seven centimetres indeed!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Hmmm… let me pull this side… and now this side…But which side is which?
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        There was only one way to find out the answer to that question. Alice took a bite of one piece of the mushroom - and shrank so quickly that she hit her chin on her foot.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Ouch!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Quickly, she ate some of the other piece of mushroom and …
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Where have my shoulders gone? And my hands – where are you, hands?
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice grew and grew until her neck was as long as a snake. Up and up she grew, through the branches and leaves, until her head was higher than the trees. Alice found she could move her neck just like a snake, bending this way and that. She was about to use her long neck to push her head down into the trees and look for her shoulders and hands, when suddenly a furious bird flew at her.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Bird</b><br>
                        Snake! Snake! You want my eggs! I know!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I'm not a snake! I'm a… I'm a little girl!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Bird</b><br>
                        Little girl or snake, it doesn't matter to me, you want my eggs just the same!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I don't want your eggs, really I don't!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Bird</b><br>
                        Then be off with you! Go away!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        The bird settled angrily into its nest. Alice ate a little of one side of the mushroom, then a little of the other, then a little of the first again until she was a good size. She decided to find her way back the door to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. As she walked through the forest she found a little clearing, with a small house in it, not much more than a metre or so high.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I wonder who lives here? The house is so small – anyone who lives here will surely be afraid of me!
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice ate a little more of the mushroom and quickly brought herself down to the right size for this little house. Next time, Alice meets a walking fish, talks to a smiling cat and has to look after a baby. Goodbye.

                        Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        And me, Sophie. Hello. Today, we're talking about the word like.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br>
                        Yes, the word like. We'll be looking at two different ways to use it.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        We'll also give you a useful tip about time expressions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br>
                        And there'll be a quiz to practice what we've studied...<br><br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        And we'll even get to find out a bit of personal information about Finn!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br>
                        Oh no, not too personal I hope!<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        Let's wait and see shall we? Now - the word like.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br>
                        Like. It's an interesting word in English, because when it comes to grammar, we can use it as a verb and we can also use like as a preposition.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        So let's start with like as a verb. And here's Neil with our first example:<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br>
                        James likes playing football.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Finn</b><br>
                        Thank you Neil. So we have the subject 'James', the verb likes, and the object playing football. Let's hear it again – this time, Neil, as a question.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Neil</b><br>
                        Does James like playing football?<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sophie</b><br>
                        This question is made with does plus the subject, plus the base form of the verb like.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        And the verb like is asking about preference – things you enjoy.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        Yes exactly. For example, I can find out about Finn's sporting preferences by asking: Do you like playing football? Do you like playing football, Finn?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        I love playing football! But sadly, I'm not very good. Now, the second way we can use like is when we ask for a description, like this:<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        What's your house like?<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        So here, like is a preposition, not a verb, and it goes at the end of the question.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        This time, we don't use do or does. The question is made of what plus the verb to be, plus the subject plus like. What's your house like, Sophie?<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        My house Finn? It's very beautiful actually! Let's have another example:<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        What was your weekend like?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        So – thank you Neil – it's what plus to be, plus a subject, plus like, to ask for a description. And as for the answer – remember to use adjectives in your descriptions. What was your weekend like, Sophie?<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        It was lovely, thank you Finn. Very relaxing! I had coffee with friends, and then we went for a long walk! What was your weekend like?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        It was very very busy. I spent the whole weekend tidying my flat.<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        You poor thing! Now, you can also use like to ask someone to describe a person. Finn, what's your dad like?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        My Dad, my Dad's great. He's very clever.<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        Clever, eh?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Yep. And he's tall... and he's a little bit bald. And he likes writing, too!<br>
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        And in this programme we're finding out a bit about Finn...<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        And we're talking about using like in two different ways.<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        We can use like as a verb to show preference, for example: 'My mother likes Italian food' or 'Does your father like reading?'<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        And we can use like as a preposition with the verb to be to ask for descriptions, starting with what and ending with like.<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        Finn, what's your girlfriend like?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        A good example but I think that's enough personal questions for one programme! It's time for a quiz. I'm going to ask three questions. For each question, first: can you decide whether I'm asking for preference or for a description. Then - answer the question! Here's the first one: Do you like Chinese food?<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        Right, well the question starts with does, and like isn't at the end, so you're asking for preference. Actually, I really like Chinese food.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Me too! Now, the next one. What's the new shopping centre like?<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        This question starts with what, ends in like, and there's no do, does or did, so you're asking for a description. The new shopping centre is usually very busy!<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Is it indeed! Now, here's the last question. What movies do you like?<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        This is an interesting one: the question starts with what, and ends with like, but it has do, so like is a verb, and you're asking for preference. What movies do I like? I like comedies.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Me too. Well done if you got those right.<br>
                        <br><b>Sophie</b><br>
                        So, that's like as a verb to talk about preference, and like as a preposition to ask for a description. Remember to use do or does for preference and to be for a description.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>

                    <p>
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Hello. Alice is in the woods. She's trying to find her way back to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. Here she is, outside a little house. She's wondering who lives there.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I wonder who could live in such a little house!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Before she had the chance to wonder for very long, a fish ran out of the woods and knocked on the door. The fish was wearing a footman's uniform. Another footman opened the door. Alice was near enough to hear what the fish said.
                        <br><br><b>Footman</b><br>
                        From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        The Duchess!!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice was so curious she went to knock on the door. But there was no use knocking, because it was so noisy inside the house that no-one could possibly hear her little knock. Alice was even more curious now so she opened the door…
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Hello?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        And she found herself in a noisy, smoky kitchen. A cook was cooking a pan of soup over the fire and the Duchess was holding a crying baby. There was also a big cat who was sitting above the fire and smiling from ear to ear. Everyone was sneezing except the cook and the cat.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        There's too much pepper in that soup! Please would you tell me why your cat grins like that?
                        <br><br><b>The Duchess</b><br>
                        It's a Cheshire-Cat, and that's why.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I didn't know Cheshire-Cats grinned. In fact, I didn't know cats could grin.
                        <br><br><b>The Duchess</b><br>
                        You don't know much, and that's a fact.
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Just then, the cook took the pan of soup off the fire, and started throwing pots and pans and plates and dishes all around the kitchen. Some of them hit the Duchess, but she didn't seem to notice. Some of them hit the baby, who was crying anyway.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Oh please! The baby! Be careful!
                        <br><br><b>The Duchess</b><br>
                        Here! You hold it if you like!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        And the Duchess threw the baby at Alice who just managed to catch it.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Ohhh!!
                        <br><br><b>The Duchess</b><br>
                        I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        And, with that, The Duchess left. Alice held the baby and wondered what to do with it.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        What am I going to do with you? You're a strange shape… Oh! You're a not a baby. You're a… you're a pig!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        It was easy to decide what to do with a pig. Alice took it outside and let it go into the woods. The Cheshire-Cat sat in a tree and watched her.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Cheshire-Cat, could you tell me which way I should go?
                        <br><br><b>Cheshire-Cat</b><br>
                        A Hatter lives over here, and a March Hare lives over there. They're both mad.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        But I don't want to meet mad people.
                        <br><br><b>Cheshire-Cat</b><br>
                        Oh, we're all mad here. Are you playing croquet with the Queen today?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I'd love to play croquet with the Queen… but she hasn't invited me.
                        <br><br><b>Cheshire-Cat</b><br>
                        You'll see me there…
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        The cat disappeared. Alice set off in the direction of the March Hare's house and soon she came to a house. Outside the house she saw a tea-party quite unlike any tea-party she had ever seen before. Next time, I'll tell you all about the Tea Party and what happened when Alice met the March Hare and the Hatter. Goodbye.

                        Here we are on the streets of London… It's an international city, full of people from all over the world. So, let's go and meet some of them!<br><br>
                        PERSON 1                      
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        Hi Milly. Nice to meet you. Whereabouts are you from?
                        <br><br><b>Milly</b><br>
                        East Grinstead in West Sussex – probably about 50 minutes south of London.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        And what's it like there?
                        <br><br><b>Milly</b><br>
                        I guess it's kind of a countryside town, so a lot different than London. Quite green and nice. I like it. 
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        What do you like the most about it?
                        <br><br><b>Milly</b><br>
                        I think you go down the high street and everyone tends to know one another. It's homely, you feel safe there. It's friendly. 
                        <br><br>PERSON 2
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        Hello, what's your name?
                        <br><br><b>Paul</b><br>
                        Hi, I'm Paul.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        Hi Paul, nice to meet you. Whereabouts do you come from?
                        <br><br><b>Paul</b><br>
                        I come from London, just down the river here.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        And what is it like?
                        <br><br><b>Paul</b><br>
                        The best way I can answer that is to tell you what I'm going to do today. I'm going to meet a friend, have a coffee, then we're going to see a play at the Globe Theatre, and afterwards there'll be plenty of places open so we'll find somewhere for a late supper.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        What is it you like most about London?
                        <br><br><b>Paul</b><br>
                        I think there are so many things that go on in the city, so many people and types of people who live here, it's just exciting and wonderful.<br><br>

                        <br><br><b>Mariska</b><br>
                        Hello, my name is Mariska.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        Hello Mariska, nice to meet you. Where are you from?
                        <br><br><b>Mariska</b><br>
                        I'm from Holland.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        What's Holland like?
                        <br><br><b>Mariska</b><br>
                        Holland is a small country, very flat, with beaches.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        What do you like about Holland?
                        <br><br><b>Mariska</b><br>
                        I like the place where I live. It's a little town near the beach. And I like the sun and the quiet. It's really quiet.

                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>

                        <br><br><b>Katie</b><br>
                        I'm from Canada.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        Wow, what is it like there?
                        <br><br><b>Katie</b><br>
                        It's really cold there.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>
                        What do you like about it?
                        <br><br><b>Katie</b><br>
                        I like how big it is.
                        <br><br><b>Emma</b><br>

                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Hello! Alice is trying to find her way back to the beautiful garden she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. On her way, she met the Cheshire-Cat in the woods, who told Alice about the March Hare and the Hatter. Alice found the March Hare and the Hatter, having a tea-party.
                        <br><br><b>Hatter and March Hare</b><br>
                        Would you like some tea? Tea? Yes please, and cake? One cake... two cakes? One lump or two?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Curiouser and curiouser. They're having a tea-party. But where are all the guests?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        The Hatter and the March Hare were sitting at one end of a very long table, which had empty cups and plates all the way along it. But the only other guest was a mouse, who was sound asleep. Alice decided to join them.
                        <br><br><b>Hatter and March Hare</b><br>
                        No room here! I'm sorry, no room!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        There's plenty of room!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice sat down. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide.
                        <br><br><b>Hatter</b><br>
                        Why is a raven like a writing desk?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Ooh, good. Riddles! I love riddles!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        The March Hare looked at Alice.
                        <br><br><b>March Hare</b><br>
                        You mean you know the answer, don't you?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Yes, I do.
                        <br><br><b>March Hare</b><br>
                        Then you should say what you mean!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I do. At least, I mean what I say. That's the same thing, isn't it?
                        <br><br><b>Hatter</b><br>
                        But why is a raven like a writing-desk? Have you guessed the answer yet?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        No. I give up. What's the answer?
                        <br><br><b>Hatter</b><br>
                        I don't know! Do you know?
                        <br><br><b>March Hare</b><br>
                        I don't know either
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I think you should only ask riddles if you know the answer.
                        <br><br><b>March Hare</b><br>
                        Have some more tea.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I haven't had any tea, have I? So I can't take more.
                        <br><br><b>Hatter</b><br>
                        You mean you can't take less. It's very easy to take more than nothing.
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice got up and walked off without saying goodbye
                        <br><br><b>March Hare</b><br>
                        More tea, Hatter?
                        <br><br><b>Hatter</b><br>
                        Don't mind if I do!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        The Hatter and the March Hare didn't seem to notice her leaving. Alice went back into the woods. She looked back as she walked away. The Hatter and the March Hare were trying to put the mouse into the teapot.
                        <br><br><b>Hatter and Hare</b><br>
                        Mousey mousey! In you go! Plop! Oh, he does wriggle so. More tea?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I'll never go there again! That was the stupidest tea-party I've ever been to in all my life!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Back in the woods, Alice saw a tree with a door in it.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        That's very curious! I wonder what could be behind a door in a tree...
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        In Wonderland anything can be behind any door. Alice opened the door and there she was at the beginning of her adventures again – in the hall with the locked doors and the table with the little key on it.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I remember that little door and the key! This time I know what to do! I'm finally going to get into the garden!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Alice had learned a lot about growing and shrinking in Wonderland. She took the key off the table first… and then ate some of the mushroom she had taken from the caterpillar and put in her pocket. Soon she was small enough to unlock the door and go through it.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Oh, it's so pretty here!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        We'll leave Alice here for now, happy in the garden at last. Soon, she's going to meet the Queen and play croquet. Will she still be happy then? I'll tell you next time.

                        Hello Finn.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        I'm holding something in my hand and you don't know what it is.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        I don't know what it is. You're right.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Can you ask me some questions to figure out what it is?<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        OK, yep, I'll ask you some questions. First of all, what's it like?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Right, it's quite small, it's hard and it's metal and some plastic as well.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Right. Small, hard, metal and plastic.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Yep.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        What colour is it?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Well it's two colours. It's black and silver.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Black and silver? Right. Is it something you use every day?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        I use it around two times a day, sometimes more.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        You use it twice a day?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Normally I use it twice a day, yes.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        I think I know what it is. Can I guess?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Well are you sure you know?<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Another question first.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        OK.<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Can you open doors with it?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        You can. Yes, you can open doors with it. Do you know?<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        It's a key isn't it?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        It is a key but what kind of key is this particular key?<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Is it a door key?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Well you can open doors with it but it's not only a door key. What else can you do with a key besides open doors?<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Does it start something?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        It starts an…<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        …does it start an engine?<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        It starts an engine so it's a…<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        …it’s a car key.<br>
                        <br><b>Finn</b><br>
                        Very good!<br>
                        <br><b>Neil</b><br>
                        Do I win?<br>

                        I went to karaoke last night. So I, sort of, don't have any voice. At about midnight last night, when I was going home… I was with Caroline, who's my manager. Her job is to, <b>like</b>, look after me. At midnight last night I was tapping her on the shoulder, because I couldn't actually say her name, because my voice had gone. And I was <b>like</b>: "Caroline, Caroline. I've got no voice. I've got no voice whatsoever." She was <b>like</b>: "Ok, ok, ok. Let's figure this out. Let's have a glass of water." It was gone.

                        A US man called emergency services after he and his family were <b>"trapped"</b> in their bedroom by an angry cat. <br>
                        Lux, a 10kg Himalayan cat, first <b>scratched</b> the family's seven-month-old baby. The man then kicked the animal in response. Lux didn't like this and became very <b>aggressive</b>, which made the family hide in a bedroom. <br>
                        In the end, police caught the cat, and the child's injuries were not serious. <br>
                        But how much of a threat are cats to the human population? <br>
                        "It's extremely rare for a <b>domestic</b> cat to behave like this", says John Bradshaw from Bristol University. With more than 80 million pet cats in the US, this unusual behaviour makes Dr Bradshaw think Lux has "<b>a screw loose</b>". <br>
                        "Cats are never aggressive for no reason," says Sarah Ellis, an expert in cat behaviour at the University of Lincoln. <br>
                        So, cats who live with people rarely attack humans. But what are <b>feral</b> cats like? <br> 
                        Sarah Ellis says if a <b>kitten</b> doesn't meet a human between the ages of 3-8 weeks, it could go feral, and may bite or scratch people. <br>
                        She says it is our "<b>duty</b>" to stop cats being afraid of humans by making sure they have the chance to spend time with people from an early age.

                        <b>Narrator</b><br>
                        Hello! After all her adventures, Alice has finally found the beautiful garden she's been looking for all this time. It's full of beautiful white roses. Alice wandered through the flowers until she saw a gardener. He was doing something very strange...
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        Why are you painting the roses red?
                        <br><br><b>Gardener</b><br>
                        The Queen - she wants red roses and I put white roses in by mistake. If the Queen finds them, she'll cut my head off! Oh no! Here comes the Queen!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>
                        The gardener threw himself to the ground and lay with his face down. A line of soldiers and courtiers came marching into the rose garden. They didn't look like people at all. They looked exactly like playing cards: their bodies were square and flat with their heads at the top and their hands and feet in the four corners. First came a group of ten soldiers, who were decorated with black clubs, then came ten of the Queen's servants, who were covered in red diamonds. Then came all the princes and princesses, wearing red hearts. The Knave of Hearts was carrying a crown on a cushion, and last of all came the King and Queen of Hearts. When they got to Alice, everybody stopped. The Queen looked at Alice.
                        <br><br><b>Queen</b><br>
                        Who is this?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>
                        I'm Alice, Your Majesty.
                        <br><br><b>Queen</b><br>
                        Can you play croquet?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>Yes!
                        <br><br><b>Queen</b><br>Come on then! Everyone get to your places!
                        <br><br><b>Animals</b><br>I'm over here... Are you over there? This is place, no this is your place, are we ready?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>Everyone began running in different directions until they got into place and the game began. It was a very curious game: everything seemed to be alive! The balls were hedgehogs and the croquet mallets were flamingos. All the playing-card-soldiers bent over so they looked like arches. The players had to catch the flamingos first, which wasn't easy because they kept flying away. When the flamingos were caught, each player held their flamingo tightly under one arm, with the long neck and head hanging down to the ground. Then the hedgehogs curled up into spiky balls – and the players used the flamingos' heads to hit the hedgehogs so that they rolled through the playing-card soldier arches.
                        <br><br><b>Animals</b><br>Is it my turn? Oh good shot! Have another go... oh do stand still! Very nicely played, it's your turn again, very good, etc...
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>What a curious game! I suppose I should play.
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>It was a very curious game! There didn't seem to be any rules. Everyone played at the same time and the hedgehogs kept running away. Alice took a flamingo and tried to hit a hedgehog with it. But the flamingo moved its head and she missed. Soon the players began arguing and fighting for the hedgehogs and the Queen went around stamping her feet and shouting at everyone.
                        <br><br><b>Queen</b><br>Off with your head! Off with her head!
                        <br><br><b>Animals</b><br>No it isn't your turn! That's my ball, give me my hedgehog! It's my turn, not yours! Is that my flamingo? That's cheating!
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>How will I get out of here?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>As Alice was looking around for a way to escape, suddenly the Cheshire-Cat appeared in the air. He wasn't sitting on anything, he was just floating.
                        <br><br><b>Cheshire-Cat</b><br>Are you enjoying the croquet?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>No. I don't think they play fairly at all. Everyone is arguing and there aren't any rules.
                        <br><br><b>Cheshire-Cat</b><br>How do you like the Queen?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>Not at all! I suppose I should try to play or she might cut off my head!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>Alice went to find her hedgehog. She found it having a fight with another one. While she was trying to pull the two animals apart, her flamingo flew away.
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>Oh dear! I'm not doing very well at this game. What will the Queen think?
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>Alice was right to worry. Most of the other players had made the Queen angry for one reason or another and the soldiers took them away one by one. Soon there were only the King, the Queen and Alice left in the game. The Queen turned to Alice.
                        <br><br><b>Queen</b><br>You! Come here! Who were you talking to?
                        <br><br><b>Alice</b><br>If you please, your Majesty...
                        <br><br><b>Voice</b><br>The trial is starting! The trial is starting!
                        <br><br><b>Queen</b><br>The trial! Oh good! I love trials! Come along!
                        <br><br><b>Narrator</b><br>Alice had no choice but to follow the Queen. We'll leave her there for now. Next time. I'll tell you all about the Knave of Hearts, the stolen jam tarts and what happened when Alice met the Hatter and The White Rabbit again. Goodbye.
